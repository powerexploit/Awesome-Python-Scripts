# Image Processing

Image Processing is most commonly termed as 'Digital Image Processing' and the domain in which it is frequently used is 'Computer Vision'. 
Don't be confused - we are going to talk about both of these terms and how they connect. 
Both Image Processing algorithms and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms take an image as input; however, in image processing,
the output is also an image, whereas in computer vision the output can be some features/information about the image.
