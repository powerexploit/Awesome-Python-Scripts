        "May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever",
        "Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.",
        "I drove my car into a   lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well",
        "Exactly!",
        "Maybe",
        "Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions",
        "And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. Theyre just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic",

        "Im not giving that to you.",
        "No",
        "You know what? This young man needs to learn thats not how you treat people. I dont care if its pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You dont just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody",
