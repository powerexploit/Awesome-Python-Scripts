Thanks very much.

So
You understand this is a very serious situation.
You made a joke?
Well I dont need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...

Jan

I dont know
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old

Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Thats not necessary.
Yes.
Oh
Isnt our interview tomorrow?
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
In the middle of a work day?
Okay.
Were only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
I dont think so.
I believe we put you in charge.
Okay
Im really looking forward to our interview.
Michael
Oh
Okay. And your strengths?
Oh. Yes. Very good.
Very good.
What do you think we could be doing better?
Okay!
Thanks for comin in
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Youre back together.
Okay
No
Okay. Uh
...what do you think about Michael Scott?
This is off the record.
Jan
Frankly
Recently
Its not.
Its not.
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.
Actually
No
I do.
Yes.
I dont know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Uh
Always hit your numbers
Uh
And that
...thats a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here
How do you think you function here in New York?
Youve been in the Scranton branch a long time.   What have you liked most about that place?
Okay. Well
So
Michael. I am very sorry.
Yeah?
Thanks
Michael
I dont understand
Michael
All in caps. Do you know what 911 means?
Now what Im curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
Okay
No.
Not without cause
You have to get along with Toby.
Yep.
Goodbye
Michael.
Is this why youre calling me?
Okay.
You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
Well if I were you
Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
So listen
Utica
Heres the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate
What say we do.
Its hard to try and evaluate yourself
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah
Hi Michael how are you?
So listen
Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor  . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook
There is a small company there
Ill fax over some of the things were looking for.
Look
This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
Good work.
Look Ill be in touch
Look
Michael
Fine. What is going on?
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? Were going to lose a fortune
How could you not know Michael?
Might have hi--- OK
Michael?
Was it the sales department?
Was it Jim?
OK
Thats too bad.
Hopefully
I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute?
Alright Dwight. This is huge.
This
Pam
Yeah?
You probably have too much to do around here. I dont want to uh
Hey guys
No. No dogs.
We are gonna call you back guys.   What is going on here?
No
Guys
What
OK
I am gone.
What gave you that idea?
I see.
Look
Youre still the branch manager
Ill give it my best shot
No.
Michael.
How did you get here
Ok.
Michael. Listen-
Well
Thats not exactly-
No.
Yes.
We didnt ask you to do that.
Yeah. Youre right. Yes. I get it. I get it
We will move some money around
What?
A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson
Hmmm.
Uh.
You know
Hi
Hi. Uh
Hello. Uh
Okay?
Ive been wondering that myself lately. Were just gonna get started
Hmm.
I find that extraordinarily surprising.
Well bring them both in.
Fellas
Yeah
I cant believe Im about to say this
Jim
Yeah.
Michael
$12
Heres the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you cant be making very much money. I dont know how your prices are so low
Okay
Okay
So youve thought it over
Yeah.
I am not firing Charles. He is very valuable.
No.
Uh
Pams not a salesperson.
Okay. Please continue.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars
Do you realize what youre asking for here? Youre talking about salary plus health benefits--
Insurance
Your company cannot be worth that much.
Michael--
Okay. Deal. Okay?
Yeah.  David and Charles leave room
playing volleyball
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic
Okay
Uh
Im sorry
Were- were closing the Buffalo branch.
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
What about the fact that theyre here today? What about that? That didnt throw up any alarms? No
Damn it
Yeah.
Dwight
Dwight.
Okay.
Okay
Okay
No
Yeah.
Okay.
Michael
Cheese platter?
Alright
Thank you Jim.
Erin
Ah
Are you sure youre okay with these new responsibilites?
Im just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyones talents.
What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
Please do.
I thought you liked Jim?
Constant office distractions
Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
Mmhmm.
Ummm... okay
Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
This is David.
Yep.
So
Michael
Well
Michael
Hey Michael
Actually
Hey guys
We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
Co-manager and Co-manager. See
Alright
Hey
But if I can be candid with you here Jim
You know what? I cant really get my head around anything like that right now
Thanks Jim.
Michael.
