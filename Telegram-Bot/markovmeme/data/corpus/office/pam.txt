Well. I dont know.
What?
Uh
You havent told me.
Uh
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
I have an important question for you.
Are you going to Angelas cat party on Sunday?
This is Mr. Scott.
I dont think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I dont think its many little girls dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
You just still have these messages from yesterday.
What?
Dont we all?
Nothing.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Jim said mixed berries? Well

Yeah.
So when are we going out?
OK. Yeah.
Hey.
Roys my fiance. Weve been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think were gonna get married in the spring.
Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
OK. Im gonna be a few minutes. So its only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
You got a fax.
What? Why?
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Post-it Notes? What are those worth
Are you serious?
I cant believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and youre firing me.
Youre a jerk.
Hey.
Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...
Its better
Yeah.
Is...?
Um... Are you...
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah. Listen
Yeah
I know. I saw that.
Im saving that cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
Um
Great.
Thank you.
Thats nice
OK
OK. If I have to do this
Mmmm.
Oh.
Sorry.
Im not making any copies.
Nothing new.
Theres nothing new.
Oh
No. I have a life.
You should try it sometime.

Dunder Mifflin
Where are you?
Actually
No youre not.
OK.
Still no one calling.
Dwight
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
Dwights health care memo. I told you about it.
Michael
Where are you going?
Im inventing new diseases.
So
Nice.
Its an epidemic.
Hey
Good
Um
You dont have anything youre doing?
Oh great. Um
I might go to the mall.
I need new shoes.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Um... Actually
Oh.
Okay
But its not until next month.
You still want to have a party?
How about green?
This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesnt like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldnt smack her.
It is... her birthday.
An alliance?
What does that even mean?
Hey
Um
Yeah
OK
Hes in a box?
Hey where are you? Yeah
Happy Birthday.
Oh
Thats perfect!
Hey
Come on.
Its just office pranks.
My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that Dwight doesnt make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? Im kidding
No
Please dont throw garbage at me.
I dont think so Michael. Besides
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Yeah
Yeah
Im just saying
And he wants to take the WaveRunners to the lake this Saturday so...
Um
Woo!
Mmm-hmm.
Hey.
Yeah
Uh
Hey
Theres a person here...
Theres...
Theres a person here who wants to sell handbags.
Okay
Okay.
Theres an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
No.
Thats a very rude thing to say
Its nice having Katy around. Its another person for Michael to um
Were not dating

Oh definitely
Oh!

Oh

Youre horrible.
Yeah
Im engaged. So...
I wished
Yeah
So

Thats what he said.
Hi.
Roy...

Im bored.
No
Really?
What are you guys going to do?
Thats great.
Thats cool.
I
Cause Roys got a truck.
Uh
Great.
Okay
Ugh...
You know what they say about a car wreck
Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now
Oh

Were not laughing at you
Um
Um
Okay
Youre taking away our bathroom?
Michael...
...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
Um...
Sorry.
...because thats what happens every time!
No.
No
If you would have asked me that
Oh no
Ill just get a ride home from Angela.
Oh good
Can I get a drink?
No
Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
Woo! Hey
More Dundies!
Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
Here here! Speech
I have so many people to thank for this award.
Okay
Um
And
Nothing.
What?
Dwight
Oh my God!
I just want to say
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
Hey
Um
Bye.
You are?
My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesnt have a cell phone... which is cool cause its kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping shell walk in.
Ive decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
mmhmm.
Oh really?
Um... I just wanted to say that... Just
Thanks
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
Shes coming in today and maybe just dont joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Thank you.
Uh... my mothers coming.
I dont have any DUIs so I can drive myself
Oh my god!
Hello!
I love my Mom. Okay. Thats probably really the most obvious statement ever.
Yeah. Im in charge of this whole area.
This is where I used to keep my computer.
But then I moved it.
Yeah
So this is like
Hey!
Well
Mom!
No.
Ten minutes.
Then we can go to dinner.
He said what?

Every so often
You see Dwights coffee mug?
Sometimes when hes not here
Here.
Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
Oh.
You headed out?
Ok.
Have a great time.
Yeah
Yup.
Yes

Flonkerton.
Are you sure you dont want to play?
Come on Angela
Well
Were friends.
I made something for our closing ceremonies.
Automatic voicemail.

I have 59 voicemails.
Sure.
Really?
Cool.
Dunder Mifflin
Katy and Jim met in the office. And now I guess theyre like going out
Hey! You can just give her your extension.
...Would You Rather?
Legends of the Fall?
Well

I take it back!
Okay.
Um

All time favorite.
You know
You should tell him.
Dwight.
Kay.
Hey!
Um... Oscars kind of cute.
Ooh
I forgot what a super
Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
You wanted me?
Papier-mache?
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Why did you put it off until Halloween?
I think its gonna put a damper on the party a little.
So its a man?
I just answer the phone.
Youre costume is fantastic!
Oh no
Okay
A dog-like obedience to authority
But that doesnt sound good.
Hes a gun nut.
No
... What?
I made brownies.
Im guessing Angelas the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.   Uh
Jim is really talented. And he should be the one whos getting a better job offer. Like
Dont take this the wrong way
Yeah
Jim...
What happened?
Oh. That was like crazy. Cause I was...
Oh
I dont really have any control over that Stanley.
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm
Umm
Its just last year you...
Well
Well
Youre major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
I am just following the website.
Yes
Could you practice on the forms?
I dont know.
French Onion?
Ok.
I just have a quick question.
No
Hes a purple belt. Thats really high.
Its just out there
Yeah.
What?
Well
Once point for me.
Oh
Hey
Yeah
The shipping place closes in a half hour.
Wait
Michael and his jeans. He gets in them
Ill take those. Thanks.
What is going on?
Oh my God
No
Umm... it was not that long ago.
Dunder-Mifflin
Ok
Ok. Um
When-
Ok. Theres a transcript between a naval ship-
Sure. Theres a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
It is a screenplay. Starring himself.
Of the FBI.
What is that?
Hey
Heres what we think happened. Michaels sidekick
Yeah.
For the bugs.
Yes... nice! I cant remember the last time someone made me dinner.
What are you going to do with your time off?
You have new music?
What!?
Oh
Dunder-Mifflin
Oh
Why might some say that?
Uh hmm.
We didnt dance.
Swaying isnt dancing.
I have some faxes to get out.
Its performance review day
Thank you.
Oh
Uh
She missed you.
I have one idea of what it means.
Well I dont think youre gonna be very happy with this.
Because shes conflicted. She has to be professional
Um
Michael and Jan definitely made out.
Maybe more.
Oh
Michael?
Jans on the phone for you.
Sorry.
What suggestion box?
Oh
Sure.
Hey
Oh my God
Can you believe who Trump fired?
You didnt see it?
Michael
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
Everyones waiting in the conference room.
Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
How do you come back from that?
No
As a human being.
Thank you.
Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
I know!
Do you think that theyre like-
No
Uhhh
Its like squishing a spider under a book. Its gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that its really dead. Sooo...   If you guys see anything... ?
Hey
One is tall and brunette
Ummmm...
Hey
Hows it going?
Listen
No. I mean
Oh.
Yeah.
The professors would go to the parties?
What?   Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!
Really? Thats great.
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
Oh
No thanks.
Hey.
Definitely.
Jims bedroom.
Cool... This is your desk.
Your home office?
Down. You have to sit down so I can get the full effect.
Ok
And Dwight would be like-
Umm
Ooooohhh no!
You were so dorky!
Hey Phyllis
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
Thats ok. Its ok.
Oh
Yeah
Just because two people are hanging out
You do realize that we cant serve liquor at the party.
I think the tree looks nice.
Oh
Yeah
Ill take the iPod.
I want the iPod.
Well
Sorry
Maybe because you hated her present so much.
How much?
I know. Its totally going to change the way I work out.
So what are you going to get me instead?
No
I traded with Dwight. Just
Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
Yeah
Oh
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh
Um
I love these.
Last week
A ski mask and a swimsuit.
And brush our teeth.
How about the anchor?
I think youre thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
No
Hey
Its getting kind of rowdy down there.
Sometimes I just dont get Roy.
I mean
Im cold.
Uh
No
No
Dunder Mifflin
Michael
Ok
Michael
Ok...
Wait a second

Uh
Michael
Michael
What was that?!
Ohhhhhh!
Oh my gosh.
Is he ok?
You missed two big conference calls today
No
You didnt have any.
And do my job?
Its just that before
Do you want some aspirin
Youve seen one of these?
Roy gave it to me for Christmas. Im trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
Really?
Oh! Ha
Pan?
Oh
What.
Tell me before I come there.
No.
No.
Really?
What?!
That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!
Oh God no
No
Wow...
Dwight
Dwight
Get up
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
I just want to say goodbye ok?
Yes
Its just hard to explain.
Oh my goodness!
Come here.
Dunder Mifflin
Oh my God
I cant believe hes getting a CAT scan.
Really? Michael went in with him?
Wow.
Ok
Ok. Bye.
Hey
I just wanted to let you that Dwights gonna be ok. The doctor said theres a really simple treatment for a concussion
I just
Oh
I bought my veil.
Ummm...
Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like
Thats a communal bowl.
Sick
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
Ok
Nuh-uh.
What did you guys talk about?
I hate you.
Hey.
Did you find anything good in your desk?
Score.
Big day.
Oh.
Right.
No
No
So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
Mmm
Cool.
Hey
Oh
No
Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
Yep.
Um
Right.
It was great.
Mm-hm.
Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year
What?
I dont know.
Oh... I dont know.
No
Open the door up!
Thanks!
A little.

Youre gonna throw my things on the ground?
...back so soon.
Yeah
Yeah
Are you kidding?
Somebody did something bad to Michaels carpet. Maybe thats all we need to know.
That doesnt seem fair.
Whats our punishment?
Hey
Hey
Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that
Ill transfer you. Dunder Mifflin
Hey
Hey
Calling from my cell phone. I dont know if you guys figured out who did that to Michaels carpet yet
Todays a women in the workplace thing. Jans coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I dont really know what. But Michaels not allowed in. She said that about five times.
Jan.
Michaels still at the door.
Mmmhmm.
I dont know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though
Thanks.
Well... I have a job right now
Well... its just that the weekends arent good because
Hey.
Hows it going down there?
Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
No.
Almost.
Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. Theres this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound
Um...
Its really cool.
Dreams are just that. Theyre dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. Its nice but... um... I dont know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
How did you know?
Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
Roys right. Theres no guarantee its going to lead to anything anyway.
What? You have something you want to say?
Oh
Yeah.
Its impractical. Im not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they dont even make houses like that in Scranton. So
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold
I really like Valentines Day in this office. Its kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year
Phyllis.
Roy and I are saving for the wedding
Thats OK.
Guess what?
Thats great.
OH
You cant fire me
You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Tightly wound?
Ok
No
That you remember her.
Yeah.
Oscar.
Join the club.
Hey.
I guess
Nothing
I mean
Heading out?
Bye.
Night Phyllis.
Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
Are you going to cry
Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... Ill uh show them to you later.
Ok
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I dont want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Mom
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
You mean Toastmasters?
Yeah
Roy has a connection. Its nicer than you think.
Of course. Hes one of my closest friends.
Maybe well use a DJ. Thats the one thing Roys in charge of for this wedding but all hes managed to do is set a date.
Ryan
Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
Thats awesome. Where are you staying?
When are you leaving?
Oh.
Oh yeah. Thats too bad.
Its ok. I got it.
Im looking forward to Take Your Daughter to Work day. I am not great with kids
Oh
Oh
I reminded you last night.
Dont you think you should say something?
Michael
Hey
I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
That is!
Hes not coming out. He wont pick up the phone.
So
Mmhmm.
Sure.
Youre welcome.
Its not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes
Really?
Okay. Um... here it is. Dont put your fingers in there.   Cool huh?
Yeah
I know.
I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.
My theory is that...  Jim signals hes leaving
Happy birthday Michael.
I said happy birthday.
Ones good.
Michael wants a strippergram?
Michael
I can sign for it.
When does he hear?
Ohh... poor Kevin.
If I knew I had a week to live
...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
And his favorite lunch.
You use fabric softener?
No
We should probably head back.
You dare me? How old are you?
over loudspeaker
Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener
Oh Im sorry. Im sorry.
I hate you.
No.
Who is that?
I got it.
Michael?
This is from all of us.
Michaels birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I dont know... It was a good day.
Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes hell look up at me from his desk and hell just be someone else. Like hell go um
He does everyone in the office.
Jinx! Buy me a coke.
No
Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Sorry
Hey guys
Oh
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Uh
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
What?   Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.   You look like you have something really important to say and you just cant for some reason.   Come on
Here.   Just buy it from me. I havent talked to you in hours and its been weird and I really want to know what the hells going on with Dwight.
Hey.
Ten minutes.
No.
Yeah?
Oh
Uh...
There are a few people I decided not to invite
Win!
How about
Win.
Win
Hey
Nice.
Um... lets move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Wait
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And Ive been really nice to her... and I havent told anyone. And what the hell?!
gets up and walks over to Angela
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
I cant believe Angela. I went against my better judgment
Dont take her side.
I dont know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Angela
I am.   Its about the Save The Date.
What?!
Okay.
Its a nice tux.
Come on
No
No
Oh
Theyre wedding bands.
Roy was supposed to pick the band
Theres a KISS cover band in here.
Im pretty happy these days. Im getting married soon and Im getting along with everybody at work.
I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Have three stages
Oh.
Oh
On the drums! On the drums!
Oh
No! No!
No
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
Michael
Carol Stills.
Your realtor.
Its still me.
Sometimes I dont put Michael through until hes already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Carol
Michael
Its still me. Uh
Oh
Yeah
I have good cards.
Mhmm
Straight.
Its okay. Ill see you at home.
Okay.
Bye! Hey.
Good
About when you want to give me more of your money?
Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. Im feeling kind of good tonight.
What?
What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Well
You have no idea...
...what your friendship means to me.
I cant. Im really sorry if you misinterpreted things. Its probably my fault.
About 10 minutes ago. No
Me too. ...I think were just drunk.
No...   Jim---
Chicken.
Excellent
Yeah
Michael
Yeah?
No
What was Oprah about?
Thats a really big decision.
Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
Or not adopt.
Roys sister looked into it
You know
Yeah.
You probably wont.
No
No
Sure.
This.
Thank you.
Yes
Ill probably just wear this.
Um...
Mm-hmm.
Hey! Whats up?
Dunder-Mifflin
Okay. Well
So how do you come up with your cartoons?
You dream in cartoons? How fun!
Huh.
Freedom fries. Yeah.
Well
More freedom fries.
Thats great.
I went on a date. It wasnt a love connection
Popcorn anyone?
Anyone else? Nooo.
Movie Monday started with training videos
Hey Kelly
Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo
Ok.
Really? I dont know.
Not at work
...noooo
Its too much.
Im gonna return it.
Hi.
Thanks.
I have this little vacuum cleaner thats broken. If Dwight doesnt work out
What?
Please go back to your desk.
Well
Hey Michael
But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
With cream and sugar?
The news that you just announced? That Ed died?
Is there anything I can do?
Yeah.
Oh. Okay.
Okay.
Oh. I would like a break.
Great.
I think so. I dont know
You waited for me?
Lets see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um
Is it for the bird?
I have it covered.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
Do you have it with you?
Did I wake up this morning thinking Id be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.
Actually
Id also like to say a few words if thats okay.
What do we know about this bird? You might think
And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I dont think he was being stupid. I think he just really
An impression
Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
Hi.
Oh
Its weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old
Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. Its really not a big deal. To some people it is.
Michael.
Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
Hey
You know
Did you have a lot of sugar today
Dunder Mifflin
Night.
20 past 5.
PM.
These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
This is a huge sale.
Night
Dunder Mifflin.
Oh my God.
Hi.
Oh.
I had to work late. Jans making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
Yeah
Do you...
Uh
A little different. What time is it there?
Oh
I dont know. It felt far.
What?
I type 90.
Its true.
70? How many do you type?
Come on. Tell me.
You have to tell me now.
No
So ok. Im watching the movie
Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
And
That movie is so scary!
But Im holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
Because I got it at Blockbuster and they dont put the pictures on the box.
Would I make that up?
Oh
I have one kitchen.
Its actually...
Three kitchens?
Hey
Um. Ok
No
You have to go?
No
I mean
Bye Jim.
Really you do. I love the material.
I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
Oh
I just feel kind of tired
Maybe. I just ...I dont really have anyone to go with.
Very official.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least Im not dressed like a slutty cheerleader
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
Yeah. Hey
Its hot in there. Hows the naan?
I am. You should come dance with us.
No one.
Here.
Yeah.
Uh... no.
Well
Yeah.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
What are you doing?
Im rejecting your...
...kiss.
If you sit in the back.
You say one more word  Im stopping the car.
Are you okay?
What did Jan want?
What cant you tell me?
What?!
You just said that were gonna be gone...?
Michael
Its a blessing in disguise. Actually
Oh
Hes not here. I dont know where he is.
Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
Sure
Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
Thats
Yeah
No thanks
Have fun though.
Really? Where did you hear that?
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah
Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. Theres another annoying boss
Hey!
Howd the run go?
Thats great!
Because he accomplished something.
Really
Really?
Oh
Yeah. Are you ready?
Set
Go!
Am I being mean to Dwight? I dont know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isnt even a stopwatch. Its a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder
I should probably get back to work.
Good morning!
Okay.
Yes! Im in a good mood today! Im excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again
Hi!
Im Pam.
Oh
Oh my god! Its really you!
I know. I dont care.
Its really good to see you.
You wont be disappointed.
Hey.
What happened to grape soda?
Oh. Youve changed so much.
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
Oh
Yeah. I know
The days going fine. Its been a little chaotic but its fine. Its great! A lot of distractions. But
Hey!
Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
Whats up?
What do you mean?
Oh. Thats totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
Were friends. Well always be friends.
Its good to have you back.
Ohhhh! Shes absolutely adorable!
...Oh
...Oh. Thats... fun for him.
Who is it?
Why would anyone go to jail for that?
Okay. Angela?
My dad.
What was prison like?
Yeah
They have art classes?
Kinda sounds like... prisons... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
Wow... I--
Wow. That was... wow.
Michael
Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
Wow. Thank you. Um
Merry Christ--  NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
Dwight
Well
I would like it off my desk.
Can I help you
Its behind you.
Michael?
I didnt
Yup.
Psst. Jim.   Um
For the past few months Ive been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.
Theyre considering him for a top secret mission. Theres his application. Oh
So... heres the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is.   Sorry I didnt wrap it.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
No
Michael
I know.
OK
Like what?
Well.. um I
I dont need to know.
No
I feel like Ive been kinda cold to Karen and theres no real reason for it. I mean its not like shes ever done anything to me. So
Hey
Um
I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
Um
That could really be fun.
You guys do a raffle?
There is now. We just started it.
Whats ours again?
Oh right.
Right
You cant do that.
Thats a great idea.
You can have your snack in here.
If youre using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present

In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
Yeah
Mmm. Hmm.
Well go tell everyone.
Night.
We should get him a bus ticket.   To make his trip easier.
It costs seventy five dollars.
Ohh...
Hey. You have a bunch of messages and...   thats nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
OK.
Its kind of serious.
How was Jamaica?
Thats good.
Huh.
Its kind of an impoverished country.
But you cant today
We couldnt do it without you
Oh my God. Is that Jan?
On the left.
Hey.
You OK?
You sure?
Oh. You want to talk about it?
Hmm.
How far away does she live now
Honestly
No
Oh
Dunder Mifflin

Ok. Bye Harvey.
Really?
Ok. Sure.
Angela
Thats great.
Dunder Mifflin
Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And Id like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.

Oh
Oh
Nope.
Hmm.
Angela?
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I think we broke his brain.
No
What?
No. No.
Somethings up with Jim and Karen. Not that Ive been eavesdropping. Its not really any of my business
Hey.
Ugh.
Everything okay?
Well you seem a little tired.
You should get more sleep.
Never underestimate the power of a good nights sleep.
When I get eight hours
Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.
Yeah. Dont fall asleep at your desk.   Oh my God.
I think thats champagne.
But dont you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?
Okay Ben Franklin!
Ben Franklin
Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
What do you mean?
Oh yeah.
Oh no
Im not into Jim. Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry.
Um
Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.
I know.
Didnt Ben Franklin have syphilis?
Ohhh.
Yeah
Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.
Thanks.
Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like Wait
Also
Thats my dress.
What do you mean?
Oh... um... no. Thats... um... Thats actually fine
Okay
Hey.
Youre kidding me
Roy
Yeah.
Its okay.
Hey!
Oh... Im pacing myself.
No. Im such a dorky dancer.
Yeah
Okay
Thanks.
Im really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I dont mean it to be braggy.
You too.
Oh
Yeah. Oh
I mean
Dwight
Oh! No
...And its all from the same series.
Called Impressions.
Not that I call myself an impressionist
I hope so.
I still need... you know
Hey
Yeah
Maybe
Thank you.
Oh
Yep.
What do you mean?
Um... you wanna buy it?
Uh-huh.
... Thank you.
Do you have something in your pocket?
No thank you.
So we shouldnt help you
No
Hey
Ok
I have decided that Im going to be more honest. Im going to tell people what I want. Directly. So
Oh
Hey guys.
Kevin
Hey. You made it.
Hey Kenny
Oh.  Starts to walk away
Nice job.
Oh yeah?
Hey
Hey
I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Oh ok
Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too
Just listen.
Dont yell!
This is over.
ROY!
Roy dont!
I really dont want to talk about it. I dont mean to be rude
Oh my God
Michael
Laughing
Its been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Sorry I almost got you killed.
He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. Its just so stupid. I mean
Not anymore. Its
Jim... I am really... sorry.
I dont know.
Im sorry too. I just
Um... no. No
No
I know.
Oh
Oh. Drew. Sorry.
Its called being smart.
I dont know how the whole betting thing started
Ten...
47
I dont understand the question.
Yeah...
Its really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.
So
Hey Creed.
Hey.
Yes!
What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Oh... God. Oh my God
Yeah...
Hey Michael! I have a present for you
Come down and... open it and youll see.
Dwight
Yes
Yeah
Were having a press conference?
Yes
Its just the Scranton Times...
You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Yes.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a womans touch.
Cut.
Cut.
One day for what?
OK.
Cut. That was your best apology video ever.
Hey
Hey
What? Really?
Oh
Can you tell us what happened?
Its just
Oh
Yeah
Its disgusting and demeaning.
Phallus?
I dont often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year.   Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jims... Whoo
Thats OK. I dont feel like answering phones.
Sleeves down to the wrists
Yeah.
Uh
Oh.
Oh
What do you want to dish about?
OK. New topic. Kelly
Michael
Oh
Michael
No
Read the pros first.
What was the last one?
Michael... you shouldnt be with someone who doesnt make you happy.
Maybe. But it sounds like youre just wrong for each other.
No one said it has no calories.
Im kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I dont need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Dont answer it.
Here
I think Ive got it.
I dont think we really need that
You know
Good luck
Dont leave a -
About 40 times a year
Michael?
David Wallace is on line one.
Oh
Thanks Toby.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
You want me to write down peoples indefinable qualities?
I have the most boring job in the office
Like what?
Well... no
Theres nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Whens the contest?
How am I supposed to... get...
I think theyre even. At various times you gave Jim ten points
I really doubt it
Im gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. Thats the right spirit when doing a coal walk
Id like to try it.
But Im not kidding. I really want to do it.
Do you want us to count to three?
Michael
Oooh
Hey! I want to say something. Ive been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just
Hey. I think it looks great.
After I had my little outburst at the beach
Hey.
Um
Oh
Wow

Hes from that company in Pitts...
What do you want me to do?
What about Meredith?
So
Uh
I really hope you get the job.
Just dont get back together with her.
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Youre so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Right.
Oh my God.   Huge!
Thats crazy!
Wow!
No
Good luck.
Im happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche
What happened?
Thank you.
Really?
You will be your own assistant.
Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely
I learned from Jim
Then who do you think will get the job?
What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.
HEY! COME ON! Lets listen to Dwights presentation!
Howd it go?
Did... Karen get the job?
Dwight
No
Medium rare. Thanks.
I know.
Well
phone rings
I havent heard anything
Yes.
to camera
It was for a video.
A celebrity s*x tape.
Not relevant.
Not relevant.
It all happened so fast.
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. Its really nice to be good friends again.
And Sunday Im thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
Cool.
Well have fun with that.
Thank God you were there.
Oh
Hey guys
No
Yeah
I was planning on it.
Angela?
Are you coming?
Cant your other cats keep her company.
Angela
OK
I can take 3 people.
Alright
Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
I...
I was thinking that we...
But...
Michael! Michael!
Its gonna be OK.
Michael
Thats cool.
Oh me too.
Same religion.
I can help you with that.
I told you Im not dating anyone. And even if I was
Michael Scotts Dunder-Mifflin
Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
Whats wrong?
Hmm...
Ah.
Angela
Im more of a dog person.
Well Im gonna start fast.
Then Im gonna run fast in the middle.
Then Im gonna end fast.
Cause theyre just stupid.
Yeah... That was um...
Yeah
... Were dating.
Ah
Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael
Giant check it is.
Not well. A doctor wont come out to collect a check for $700.00
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
I dont think so.
Michael
Hey.
Oh my God.
You said come in!
Oh my God.
So I closed the door but the image of his...
... dangling participle...
... still burned in my eyes.
Come in.
Yes. Or come in.
On average
Theyre so not.
I didnt see where it started but I saw where it ended.
They say if youre nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
What? Look
Yeah.   Oh were in last place.
Darn it.
I dont know Im really committed to winning.
Mmm... Yes.
Yeah.
You like it? Its kinda designy and cool
Yeah probably. Hey
Im still having a nice day.
Yeah. Hey Michael
And Michael
Yeah
I know you Michael
Hey.
I gotcha one.
Yeah.
No. Thanks... uh were still having lunch today
Toby
Phones ringing.
Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
You might want to trim it a little.
Yeah
Hey Toby.
Well
OK.
Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
Yeah.
No..
No
You didnt say anything to me?
Can you believe that...
OK.
Hi.
In his office. You can go right in.
Michael told us to wait in here. We dont know why.
Reusing the Ben Kingsley
Oh.
I think that I should help him get home.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Whoa
Hey.
Its funny you bring that up because yes it is.
I think... I mean
I now find you repulsive.
Eh...
OK.
Uh totally.
Yeah.
Thank you.
OK.
Yeah
So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious
Thanks.
Thatd be great.
Oh... is it...
No...
Um...
Im uh
Were together.
Yeah
OK great!
Great.
I saw it. I saw it
Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
He does.
Dwight mercy killed Angelas cat. Its very complicated. Its caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
Hes going through a break-up.
What kind of prank are you thinking?
Yes its too tight.
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
Uh
One of the tickets is for him.
I won.
Tie goes to the girlfriend.
Heres a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why dont you zero one one
Hello.
Um... uh... Ill get back to you.
The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
I said it normal.
Michael
Im all over it.
Yeah
You came up to my desk
Yep.
Nope.
Ah-ha.
Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office
Hes a big Meryl Streep fan
A suit?
Like the main company number? Because Im gonna have to call information.
You finished the movie.
No. Go ahead.
Mo Chuisle. Hes watching Million Dollar Baby... Hes gonna try to kill me.
Michael
Hello
It says here you cater to the eldery.
Trip Advsior.
Two?
Shoot!
We only had tonight free
You wouldnt understand
The Beets Motel.
Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
I dont know!
Oh my gosh.
What are the themes?
Irrigation.
What?
Yeah. Coward.
Oh my God. What century is this?
Ugh
Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight
Its whom when its the object of a sentence
How did he use it again?
Whats up?
Youre being gross.
What moves?
I cant believe thats not working.
Um
Shes very religious.
Okay
Thats right
Now that I think about it
Michael.
Whats going on
Doesnt Jan have money?
Man
We wrote a good review. Under comments
Table making never seemed so possible.
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
We really did. It was fun.
Dwight.
Hey
Okay.
Yeah.
Jims just really passionate about Italian food.
Im taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
No talk
Are you serious?
Oh my God
Whos that?
He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
Right... youre a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
No no no
Oh boy.
Maybe
No no
Dunder Mifflin
Thank you.
I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office
Yes?
Certainly.   Okay
Thanks.
Oscar
Okay
Oscar
Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
Some people.
I have Ben Nugent on the line

Its Vivaldi
And spend time with George Emerson. Thats what I would do. I mean its the best male protagonist weve read
Uh
I think its interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion.   And that also brought up themes of
It just-   To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times
Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
Very brave choice also
Why dont you use the microwave in the kitchen
Im so sorry


Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a get to know you weekend. Michael wasnt invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
Did you sleep in cabins?
Who went?
Do you want me to ask where youre going?
Great.
Oh.
Wow! Youre shaking things up a bit
Do you think its a good idea?
Hmm.
Wow! That was easy.
Conference room?
Every time Michaels in a meeting
The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
Hi
I dont wanna guess.
Jim. Can I see you for a second?
Okay
Please? Kellys trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
Sorta
Okay.
Hey
He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
Yeah
Hows it going?
Nice. So
Ill make the call.
Yes! Way to go.   See that?
You know what? Im sick of this! Lets go
Lets go. Pick up a paddle.
I am.
In my sleep.
O.  hits the ping-pong ball
We got you this.
Its really nice.
Uh-huh.
So you have an office and a workspace?
What a cute bench.
Yeah
Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?
I dont care what they say
Montana.
Joe Montana!
Why didnt you just say 49ers quarterback?
Oh okay.
Oh Jim
You can buy new stuff but you cant buy a new party.
Michael offers his coat to Pam
Is there more wine in the kitchen?
No
Oh
I have never
Awesome.
Like... like what?
I know Jan didnt poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldnt it be me? Michaels former lover?
And now you guys are dating?
Flooded.
This is the best burger Ive ever had
Hmm?
Hunters voice starts singing
W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
Nature.
Some of us like the walk more than others.
Did you pick a new chair? Its been awhile.
But instead
Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldnt care
Her?
The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
Or in a great chair.
I definitely remember your dinner party.
Actually
No
Who are you putting down?
Who is it?
Yeah
OK Michael
No
Im setting Michael up with my land lady. Shes really sweet and... whatever
Shes sweet and cute. I thought youd get along.
I know.
Oh I dont care
Yeah
No
Hmm
Oh
OK
Oh
Ohh kay.
Ive been warned.
Nice job.
I dont know
I hate you.
Oh
How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
Whats wrong Michael?
You do.
We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
No Dwight
You cant
There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked
I told you
Aw! Thats great Toby.
Toby
Phyllis.
I know how to throw a football.
Actually
I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned
Michael we dont know what youre talking about...
Shes talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
Um... yeah
I dont have my contacts...
Dont
If you propose to me during a Michael meeting
Oh
Oh
I should probably get back to...
Entering the....
No.   Dunder Mifflin
Hey
Because youre very important?
What does that mean?
I cant find my glasses.
Okay
I think you look nice.
So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didnt have to play volleyball
Um
Theres some filing
Yeah
This is Michael
Hes nice and he seems interested.
I only brought the one.
Michael
Okay. Ill go look for another one.
My old art room.   Oh
A piece of paper.
Well I think theyll get the spirit of it.
Are you serious?
Okay.
Just checking in
I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So
Talk to you later?
Excuse me.
Beers? You closed it?
Yes! Oh!  runs into his arms
Well done.
Hi.
I was just wondering
Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
I can do that.
I dont know any of those.

All right. Cool
And uh

Okay.
Thanks.
Hey
Oh my goodness

So how much antigravity potion do you want?
Hi
Hey.
Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
Oh
I dont know
So
Yeah
Ohh...
I wouldnt go if things werent so solid with Jim. And down the road
Do you like it? Its a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
Well I was taking the picture.
Sure
Okay...
Did you need me to take notes?
Okay.
Toby
Michael...
So what is your gift?
What is it?
Your watch?
I just knew.
Is that the police?
Absolutely.
Wow. Look at our parking lot.
Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is

Sure. Meredith
I dont know
Michael.
Hey
Kelly
I got it.
Hey
Jan called and asked where youre going to meet for dinner. She wants you to call her.
Sure.
Michael doesnt know how to work his BlackBerry. So when he says BlackBerry me a message
Hey
Excuse me?
Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.
The city mirrors
The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?
Put cold tea bags on your eyes.
Yeah.
Mmhmm.
Mmm. Mmm-mmm.
Thank you
Whered he go?
Mose
Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?
Okay
Yeah.
Yeah
Yeah
How about Darryl?
Oh
So
Wait
Right. And
A little bit.
Because you love her?   Because you love her very much?
Okay. Have fun with your girlfriend!
Im kidding around. We joke about that stuff all the time. Im not really the jealous type
Oh
Oh
Yes
I dont think so.
Heres the thing. When Michael invents a hypothetical situation
I do.
No.
Youre welcome. Open or closed?
No.
Yeah. Dwight
Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.
Couple minutes
What are you doing?
Blah
Now. Get good work done. Concentrate.
On your backhand.
to Jim
Not with your hands.
Oh
Mmm-mm. Im probably just gonna stay here for a while
It was just a little...
Where did you grow up?
Wow
I dont have anybody.
No...
Sorry.
No
I just...
Are you talking about Beverley?
Because shes not a s*x model. Shes a tollbooth operator.
Thats the other Boleyn girl.
Shh.
Mmm?
Im supposed to turn the lock when I leave
What kind of stuff does Stanley say?
Michael
Hi everyone. My name is Pam
Thanks
Really?
Huh. Maybe I will.
Whats it like without my glasses? Um
Hi
Ryan!
Yeah.
Okay.
Ive heard that.
Okay.
Yeah
Hi
Thank you!
Hey.
Did you just buy that?
Ahh! Im sorry
Dwight.   Michael will be out in a second.
Not almost
Just
Yes.
Yes.
I have everything.
Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple.   What up
I should really get going.
Im sure it was really lovely.
OK
No
Im in the wrong class...
Oh
I can see you!
This is so cool.
Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. Im gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
Can you put me down Im getting a little nauseous?
The nerve.
Theyre on the supply shelf.
New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The citys awesome. Um
Hi.   Mmm. Cause--
What?
Really
Wow
Hey! Jim! Um
Nice.
Sorry.
Youve already disappointed him so much. He cant be expecting a lot from you.
I... listen
No football games
OK.
Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer
What are you doing?
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Yes!
Well
No
Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
What? Why not?
Come on
Hi everyone!
Wow.
No
Sorry.
So you know Stacy
Theres no one from England
So
Anyway
No
So Sarah Kaya says to Eric
Yes!
No
No
Oh
Hey you!
Not even. Im doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
I cant hear anything
I cant hear anything!
OK.
Im not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton
Hi.
on voicemail
I figured Id catch you walking to your car
Ill leave a message.
I guess this is just one of those days. Itll get better.
I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
And then
Youre probably upset that Im even at a Laundromat right now. But
Anyway
Okay
New York
Hey.
Of course
Hey Michael.
Hey.
Thanks. My costumes getting a lot of attention.
So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I cant even take off my hat
Hey!
How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome
Okay
So
Okay
Oookay....
They came up with that idea really fast.
Hey guys.
Hi!
Yup!
Cute.
Miles Davis.
Chet ...something.
Dizzy Gillespie.
I dont know if Im gonna make any money with art.
I mean its a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise
... Got you.
For the record
Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class
Thank you.
Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
Hey
Its the worlds tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim
We wanted to stay on the phone all day
I should go.
I miss him.
Dont give him Snoopy. Thats mine.
What was that?
Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
Good luck.
I love you.
Jim? Jim?
Maybe its because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
Ooh
in New York
Thats what she said! Thats what she said! Thats what she said!
That was weird.
Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didnt go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
Did you do something to her?
Well
Yes
Right Dwight is loud.
Hey
Its Alex.
Oh
OK.
Whats up?
Wow.
Because they have a great design program
Jims in Scranton.
Ill see you tomorrow.
Cant believe this.
I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
I was
I have to stay and retake it.
That means another twelve weeks.   Can you do this for another three months?
I know.
Right.
Yeah Im fine. Um... my cell phone batterys low
Alright.
Love you. Bye.
Im coming back the wrong way.   Its not because of you. I dont like graphic design. Thats it.   Stop smiling. I really didnt like it. Its just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way
I missed you too.
Uh
Im not going inside.
pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave
Yeah. Wait
Dont you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
Just because someone likes things clean
When it comes down to it
Why arent you as mad or interested in this as me?
Are you inching away from me?
Reach your arms out.
What do you need
Please hug and kiss me
Thank you.
I know
I guess thats why we have a temp
How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
Youve seen things cleaned before though
I dont know anything about that.
Here?
Sure.
What are we doing at your parents house?
I dont get it.
I love it.
Yeah
I mean
You bought me a house!
Um

Hey.
So um
I really think you should reconsider.
Yeah
But I really think you should reconsider.
Jim. Jim

Well that never happened.
So

Thank you.
Michael?
Hey!
You got a second?
Oh
Oh
Hey
Yeah
That is amazing!

No.
No way!
Yeah! Oh

But not everyone...
Or even uses the copier every day.
Yeah
...Thats it.
All right
Hot tie guy.
No
Yeah. I have my copies.
And I have my original.  holds up original paper
So suck it.
Theres that ass!
Woo! Yeah. Aw
Did somebody call Hank?
You can try mine.
Yeah
You can do that?
Youre gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
Or chairs?
So whats it gonna be?
Let me just say
Hey.
Thanks Michael.
Yeah
I wish that youd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
I know. If she wasnt an alcoholic before
I knew it.
I knew some of it.
Its Christmas.
Thank you. I knew it.
Dunder Mifflin
Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building
Quick announcement : new year

Kevin!
Ladies

Hillary swank.
Oh
The phones are dead.
Try a different door.
What do we do?
We dont normally download films illegally. Because were honest
But Andy does
My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jims been great. But Im gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
Hes not saying what he needs to say.
Yeah.
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream
So he doesnt share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughters fiance?
Hey.
Um

I dunno. I mean
Youre good to talk to.
What?  opens her eyes
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh
What did you say to my dad?
After you talked
What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour
Well
Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh
I think he meant personal day.
Phyllis theres a package for you.
Hey Dad. No I know
Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room
Yeah.
When youre a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.  Andy is in the background
Michael! Its really good to see you.
What?
Ugh.
Good morning.
He brought a sled.
Yeah. I love being on the road
Separate rooms.
Im going to say it anyway.
This is a new cardigan.
No.
Can I turn on the radio?
But then you fall asleep and theres nothing for me to do.
Thats dangerous.
Thats okay I can... Im fine. Ill just play a song in my head.
No
No
I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me
Okay
Stop it
Please cut it out.
Michael!
No its not.
So when are you due?
Wow
Oh
What is happening there?
Its really sweet.
Uh
Thank you.

So
Okay
You look good.

Listen
You know
Yeah
Maybe. One step at a time.
You can do this.
Oh
Michael

That was weird
Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Hollys boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection
Dont look up. Dont look up.
No.
What?
Oh
You did what?
She never sent it to you?
No.
No
Because
I could read it.
Yeah

Its deleted.
She still has feelings for you.
I cant tell you specifically

No
You mean Tony?
Oh
Good morning
Im sorry
Shoot.
They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman
That is a great idea.
Um
There he is!
Ayyyy!
That was funny.
This is our first and only Valentines Day as fiances.
Really
I cant see them when theyre on the floor
You cant be a part of our relationship
What do you think?
Were in.
Anything to get out of that office.
Wow
What?
Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
Yes
No
Whats the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
Oh
Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries.
What?
Well
Do you think they dined and dashed?
I thought we were having a nice time.
Yeah.
Mine too.
My God.
Yep

Good morning
Good morning
Jelly beans.
You dont have to wait that long. I mean
Thats psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
Dunder Mifflin
When Michaels skirting a phone call
Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?
Dunder Mifflin
I dont think Jim means to say that you shouldnt touch her.
Shush.   Kevin
Thanks for much for helping the company
Sure.
Its actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
OK.
Not classy.
Hi
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Michael
Yeah
This is what you did last night?
He just had to wear his tux today.
Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
Uh
Oh no.
I can tell Michaels mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do
And then
Cupcake. Its cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Its really just a regular shaped cake.
He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
Okay focus. Focus. Youre in the right building
Do you have any leads on a job?
Hi.
Uh
Hmm?
Im working on it Kev.
Itll be ready soon.
Is that what soon means to you?
Then come back soon.
During the course of business
Yesterday
No
Thats a really... well fine
Hmm...
Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? Cause its a pretty big risk.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Well
Yeah. Good.
Mmm-hmm
Everyone
Meredith...   Oh... so uh... G-44. Its not ready Kevin!
Im at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier
Hows it working?
Good.
I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons
Michael?
Oh no.
Im going with him.
Im going.
Michael
Yeah.
Great. Uh
Salesman.
Oh
Probably.
Okay
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know
Michael
Are you wearing anything under the robe?
This looks great
Yes

So
Im full.
I feel good.   Wow.
Yeah. Im excited to start the company.
We did that. So
No
Just let me have... Oh.
Fine!   Oh
You know
I know! No
Okay
I think you should get dressed.
Michael
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Great.
No. What? Why?
No. Were not gonna hire Ryan.
Okay.
Well find him.
Really?
We have an investor already?
Michael
Hey! We need to get you dressed!
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out
Next on the list - open the mail.
No
Next on the list -- song parodies.
Great. Lets sing it in the car.
Yeah.
We can do this.
Michael comes out with Vikram
We have a meeting with an investor today.
He can be.
Hm. Im looking forward to getting to know you better
Yes. Yes
Michael! Whats going on?
Hey
This wasnt on the list.
No.
Its not.
When did you add this to the list?
You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
No.
What is he doing?
Oh my God.
Sorry!
Sure.
Beat.
Nana?
It means grandmother.
I cant do this.
I cant do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I
We dont have any money. We dont have an office. We dont have anything.
How come out of everyone in the office
Yeah.
I could work here. I could see this.
Are you good?
Im good.
Morning Michael!
What should we do now?
I make that one copy
That is so insulting.
Because the thing youre saying Im good at
Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Shut up!
Really!
Seriously? This is whats so important
I dont want to look at your friend Jasmines boobs all day.
Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Oh yeah I bet.
Michael
Okay its my turn.
Give it back for what? Whatre you gonna do with it?
Youre gonna make another spreadsheet.
Yeah exactly. Its my turn.
Come on! Ryan!
Definitely.
We could work from home.
.... Corner idea?
How would we know that?
I thought that was your corner.
So my corners the one with the copier?
No thanks.
Hey Im here to see Charles.
Hey Charles.
I know youre a very busy man so Ill cut right to the chase. Id like my old job back.
Um
Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail
Personal shopper?
Well it was great catching up with you. And Ill see you around the building.
Im just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if thats okay. The air smells so good. I dont remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Hey.
Yeah
Thats as specific as Id like to be.
Were small
Nope
Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company
We already offered free delivery!
Um
A guarantee of what?
And I guarantee
I made a sale!
Oh!
Things are a little slow here. And theres only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out theres no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someones face.
Were getting pretty good at it.
The timelines messy.
Im confused. Am I walking down the aisle to You Can Call Me Al?
I dont know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Mm-hmm.
Im not gonna do that.
Im here. Im a part of this now.
Michael
Tell us what youre talking about.
We cant help you if you dont just tell us what happened.
Michael!
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry
Pam
Oh my God
We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says Alleluia Church of Scranton. in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
You didnt happen to bring any coffee
Oh
Do you drink this every day?
Oh
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Yeah
Corporate greed?
Did it help?
When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree
We have maybe a month. I dont know what Im gonna do.
Thats what Michael said.
I like it.
Steve Martins not dead
You want to hear something sad?
So Jim and I are getting married and the weddings really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy
Really?
Seriously? Are you being serious?
Yes.
Just to reiterate
No
We have to come from a position of strength.
Mm-hmm.
$60
Are you kidding me?
Can you give us another minute please?
Michael.
Why are you assuming youd get the whole thing?
No
Agreed. But thats all
Thank you.
Thats right.
Alright!
Who is it?
Boscovs at the Steamtown Mall?
Well
What?
Oh
Thank
That ones great.
What?
Mm-hmmm.
We were something else.
Mmm.
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. Its okay
He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. Hell make his decision by the end of the day.
Oh. I think you should get it. Youve changed a lot and youd be good at it.
Yeah.
Just tell me.
No
Okay
I did?
For real
I did?
Oh
Thank you. You will not be sorry.
Oh.   I really thought I didnt get it.
Yeah. Cause you said I didnt
What about Ryan?
Yeah. Maybe you shouldnt fake fire people anymore.
Thanks
Erin.
Erin. Michael wants to see you.
Not cool
Oh
Just sent it.
If you dont take out his battery
Oh
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Were getting married today.
Tell em how it happened.
And very expensive.
You cant leave anyone out.
Ok
I had just woken up. I didnt look cute. Thats how I knew he meant it.
What?
Theyre beautiful.
Yeah.
This is so cheesy.
I like cheesy.
Yeah. I think maybe I want a wedding wedding.
Really?
I can do it.
You had to be there.
Yeah
Okay.
Oh
Tell them what happened last year.
No
Yeah
Hey Charles.
Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Back off
Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Hyuh!   Well
Good game!
How do you figure?
Lets do this.
I got it!
Oof!
Yep. No
Yeah.
No
Look
Well be back!
How long will that take?
Im sorry
This is the last day of our summer interns. Its been nice. We havent had interns for a while
Nobody.
We havent told anyone Im pregnant.
Yeah
Nope.
Cant back out now
No
Just keep it to yourself then.
What?
Why did that come into your brain?
Who did you tell?
Nobody!
Sure
Michael?   Hes over here!
Where are you going?
Dont get on it.
Dont... get... on. Do not.
Step away.
Jim.
Stop. Dont. Just...
Yes.
Okay.
Its clear why we were trying not to tell people. Thats clear now.  Jim nods
Youre right. We shouldve realized that you are an equal part of this.
You called Stanleys wife?
If you talk to her
Michael
Hey
Okay
Yeah
Ummm
Did I? Doesnt sound like me
Please dont talk about my breast milk.
Yeah.
Hey Kelly.
Thank you. Um
I dont know
We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldnt be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.   Which is why were having it in Niagara Falls.   Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off
Hey Ryan.
So
It costs about $75 per person.
Can you just tell me now if youre coming or not?
Okay
Kelly Kapoor
Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
Well
You are going to text me
To ask for directions..
And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
So rude
Oh my gosh
I need to fit into my wedding dress. However
We did
Its awkward asking people for money
Oh
No
I dont think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is this what Ive become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible.   oh look! Mrs. Pam Halpert! Thats the first time Ive seen it in writing!
Why arent there any beans on this very old
Jim?
Yeah
$100 now for sure.
Yeah. No
How sure is this?
The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
writes a check
Im sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomachs a little more sensitive lately. So
Phyllis
I dont think Im asking for too much. I guess its just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
Yeah
Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
Well
You know
Next time were all in this room Jim and I will be married.
Thank you
See you later.
Hey
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
Yeah.
Oh.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
Can we take a look at the suite now?
Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
Im gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets
Oh
Hey
Oh. Thank you... but nobodys perfect.

I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
Nevermind.
Yeah.
No.

Andy
Hey
He tore his scrotum dancing.
He is in my room icing his balls.
Please stop saying what. Can you take him?
Your brothers took you out drinking?
Thats Michael. Youre out with Michael?
Okay

Andy

He does.
Yes. Thank you
Okay great.   Yeah

No. No
Hey.
Terrible.
My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and Im five months pregnant that Im not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Thank you.
No
Everyones driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andys scrotum.   And my mom wont stop freaking out about my dads new girlfriend.   This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?
You look great.
Mm-hmm.
Yes I did.
Go ahead. I think its your turn.
Yeah
Saw it.
Hey Oscar. Its Pam. Hey. Were on our honeymoon.
Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger
Are you kidding me?
Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
It really was.
Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort
Frank and beans!

Michael

Michael
Whats that supposed to mean?
Shut it!
Awww
Mmmm.
Haha
Maybe Im overreacting.
But I dont think I am.
Here we are outside-

Here it is.   Suite 401.
I know. Now you dont have to.
Oh. No
And wed like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.

You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
You blew the sale

I love to watch him dance.
And Ill just watch him.
Yes.
Mmm-hmm.

Youre fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
Hmm.
Well
Ah.
Ah.
Hey

Yeah
Thats... right. Hes like Marlon Brando.
I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
Oh
I have an early lunch.
Michaels been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I dont know. I really hoped this thing would just die out
Hey!   Hey. Happy birthday.
I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
Kevin!
Yes
Oh
I know. Isnt that always how it goes?
I want to handle it.
I feel like its--
Yeah-- its exciting.
Thank you.
Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didnt even blow it.
I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh
Michael
So
49 again? Thats nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.
Mom
Please be Grandma.
I want you to be Grandma.
Yay
Maybe.
What about your gift Michael?
He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
Aww--
Thats amazing.
Yeah.
Thats really nice Michael.
Home run Michael.
Hey. Whered you go?
And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
Okay
Cakes really good.
Michael. Michael
I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to
Well--
Michael.
What?
I am working.
Really?
Really?
Why?
I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
I have the worst attitude of any person here.
Yeah
Youre bribing me?
I want to hit you.
I want to hit you. Ill do that.
No. Are you kidding?
No. I dont think I can hit you in the office.
So
Okay.
See you then.
Oh...
Right.
Okay.
Okay wait-- its-- youre saying it comes from the foot.
Okay.
Wow!
Are you ready?
You have to keep your hands down
Michael
What are you sorry for?
How about for dating my mom?
And dumping her on her birthday.
Okay-- just-- dont ever date a member of my family again.
Are you okay?
Youre okay.
No. You were right.
Michael
Who are you?
Ill go.  stands up
Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than Id hurt a June bug.
I do not.
I think Michael may have snapped.
Well
Jim
I should just go.   Where to now Caleb?
Whats the news?
It wasnt me. Im not goin down for this!
Get the keys out of my purse
Oh my God
The thing I like most about Recyclops is that hes creating a different world for our child.
A world where you truly can be anything you want.
Thats great.
Sure.
Dont do the twirl.
Stuff gets around. I dont participate.
I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
Can you actually fire people?
Well
Oh. Ok. Ive heard you exclaim. Like the time you said
Well
Looks great.
Okay.   The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
Michael
No Michael
Michael
Its terrible.
Just terrible. And the longer you put it off
No!
You have to tell them.
Its fine. Erin
Ok
Thank you.
No
Yup.
Ah!

So Santa
You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if its a family recipe
Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting
Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
Michael
Have you talked to him?
Matt?
Mmm! Good pate
Hey
Oscars pate is great. I could eat it all day
Okay.
Yes! Theyre the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
How could we do what?
Twelve drummers drumming.  marching drum band lines up to perform
Hello.
Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
It might seem crazy
For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although
Good to meet you.
Well
Yep
Yep.
Yes.
Oh
No
What do you want us to do?
Because were usually not on the same page.
Hey.
Oh
We found a great local daycare. Its rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means its also really hard to get into.
Were hoping our interview seals the deal.
Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Theres a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
What?
Who? The -
The guy were meeting with?
Hi Jerry.
Its lovely.
Ok
Hes uncomfortable because youre acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
Thats the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
Maybe
Nope. Cause were really nice people but you dont seem to like us.
So
Oh
Michael
Michael...
He looks happy.
I just wanted to check and see if theres anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah
There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
Kevin
Hmm.
Mmmm
No
Im having contractions
If we check in after midnight
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Ooh.
You know the babys not going to live here
Okay
Everythings fine. We have plenty of time.

How does one do that?
Do you want to try it
I cant tell if shes getting anything. It just doesnt really feel right.
Even if shes not getting anything?

Shes just
Maybe itll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
I know.
Yes?
Um
So
Oh
Okay.
Okay.

No. It just feels like pressure.
Okay. So

Oh

Theyre both single
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Hey
Aw!
Yeah!
Hey
This is my friend Julie.
Julie laughs at everything.
Hey
You want to play pool?
Ok.
Hey
Why are you wearing a hat now?
Maybe.
Maybe it should come from a man.
Hey
Ok
You guys are stripes
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Really?
Im sorry
Hes more
Okay. Bye.
Yeah.
Oh-oh
Okay
Not at all.
Hey
Its my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece
at her desk
Its nice to see you again
Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
No
Thats weird
You know what
Mm.  walks into bathroom
What are you doing?!
Relax?!
Give it back to me now.
Its disgusting!
Its not sterile!
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
No
Hey
What? What do you mean
Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Yeah. And he worked here too.
No
Thank you.
Hey Toby.
Very interesting.
Thanks Toby.
I dont think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Yeah. I vant to count to ten.
That would have been funny.
You know
This is our first joint sales pitch. I think were gonna work really well together.
We have good give and take.   I give
Yee.
Oh
Ill have one.
Maybe Michael has a point. I mean
What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Who cares?   Its not that huge a sale.
Dont act like you understood anything that guy said.   Good luck
Maybe shes just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
I was after your money.
Yes
Hmm?
Um... I think its really
Really unlikely. But I cant say that its impossible.
Im not saying shes in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone
Hey
You know what
Mm-hmm.
Yeah
Michael...
She doesnt want you to return the barrette. Shes not interested in you.
Im sorry.
Michael!
It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop
Stanley got to go.
No
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
That is right. Dont make any more of it.
How what?
You could start by concluding this meeting.
Michael
Amok. It means
Michael
Oh!...
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
No
Michael. Okay
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship youre in.
Helene.
My mother.
My mother
Hmm? Oh. Its probably nothing.
Okay
No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common
Hey
Im sorry to interrupt you. Um
I lied its personal. Its about me and Jim. Were... I just... youre the only person I can talk to.
And...
No
Yes. Yes
I need you to sign this! So bad!
I love  ... this idea is neat. Ive never been. It sounds lovely.
Youre gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh
Absolutely.
I dont know who he is.
What?
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
You have to settle down first.
Okay. Okay. Yes.
Yeah
Okay. Look at this
Hi
Did she see me?
What flavors did you get?
Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
No
Yeah
Yeah
And we need bodies in both these rooms
Oh
No
Leave!
Oh
Thats awesome. You want some ice cream?
Could he still be seeing her?
Me too!
Hey Michael.
We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight
We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Yes.
Michael Scott
Mm. Hey. Oh
You were supposed to be the Lookout.
So embarrassing.
We will be well-rested tomorrow.
I dont think those were yours to take.
Did you talk to him?
You talked to the man whose wife youre having an affair with.
I dont think Im gonna make it.
It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it
Well
You sleep in the warehouse?
Okay.
It was me.
Okay. Im talking to this woman at daycare...
Shes telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam
Her husbands a reporter.
So now everyone hates Andy
I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
I dont know what to do! Do I go tell Jo
That fast?
Yeah?  Michael points at Pam
Yeah
I have never seen so many parking tickets.
Um...
Were not going for yogurt.
Wouldnt we get fired for smashing all the computers?
I dont think thats a good idea.
Nobodys going to prison
Yes
Hey. What are you doing?
Sorry.
It was really funny.
I love you.
Why is there a circle with a line through it?
Or enough for everyone?
Get whatever you want
I dont know. That usually works.
I feel horrible for blowing Jims prank. I dont know if you can tell
Yeah
Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
Yeah
There we go.
Lets just calm down.
I dont-
Ok
Dwight
Youve gotta be kidding me.
Oh
I know. Yeah
Well
They do call me that.
Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also
Yeah.
Stop drinking the water! Stop!
We signed Cici up for this daycare. Its on the other side of town. The traffic...
Were you painting in the dark?
I dont really think we need...
Yeah.
And a soy sauce packet.
Look
I cant do this. I dont have this sales gene
Tell me Im good at sales.
The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So
Yeah
So what happened?
I am. I am the office administrator!
Oh
There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. Thats the main way. But this could work.
A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate
Thanks! Yeah
I get paid $40
Maybe $50
No
I liked them.
Hey
Well
And
I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
Hey Michael
There are a lot of one person departments here
We can do that.
Easily.
But of course!
So weird that there is no paperwork.
Although
Admit what?
Say it.
Say that Im lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement
Great. Well
Sure. Anything else?
Ill get it right away.
The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2:00 AM
Oh
Well keep looking.
I mean
Yeah.
Hey
We can relax.
Sounds like Cece.
Oh
Why are you here?
What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I dont... you know
You know what? It doesnt matter. It doesnt matter.
Okay.
Not together!
This night was a disaster.
Yeah?
Get it.
Lets get our juice on.
No. No no no!
Nate starts walking away from hornets nest
Yeah
What? No! Wait
Its just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
Wait! What you should do
Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
Andy thats way too personal of a question.
Okay.
Michael!
Come on
Not the car!
Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
Thats fizzling. I mean
No
You dont look reluctant
You dont?
Not really. Its kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
turns around
People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize
What?
Im supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when Im standing next to Popeye
We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
Except where Juliet doesnt have that great a time and Romeo doesnt call back after two dates.
But Ive learned to love again.   Hes a cartoon sailor.
And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
Um
Oh
It was two.
No
Yeah?   It was though
Hmm-mm.
Okay
Michael
Dressing up as somebody-I mean
Angela as the nurse!
Id remember talking about Jim. That wasnt it.
I did. And its just one of those things thats going to keep gnawing at me
Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know?   Okay. Well
Oh
Aww
Okay
I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. Its that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona
One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
Oh
Well
And get your flu shot. Also
Im not - Im not going to do that. Im not going to do that.
Ceces getting christened today.
Everyone from work is here. We werent planning on that.
Oh
Okay
Im sorry
Okay
Our friend
No
Okay. Thank you for coming
Somebody needs a change.
Well
What?
Honey
No
We have an extra outfit in the bag.
You said you checked it.
Wow.
We just had to add a few more tables. We werent expecting this many people.
Nope
Hm. Dont listen to her. Shes just jealous cause she doesnt get to come home to someone as cute as you.
I dont know. Im just hungry.
Cece went down.
Well
Who the heck was that?
We need more food. Ill go get some subs and sodas.
Honey.
Did you lose Cece?
Shes up! Great!
Cece
Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. Its closer to the TV. Itll seem louder.
You have a gun in your desk?
Maybe I should go.
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
I cant even talk about it.
I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
Its a miracle. She loves him.
No no no no no! Shell wake up!
Look
Absolutely!
Do it!
Jim
What no
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
No no no
The reverse cycling ends tonight!
knocking on Angelas car window
I know you and Dwight have this weird deal
Yes! I have been so authorized.
Okay.
You know
Wait
Lord of the Ring stuff? I dont know
Youre typing Big Boobs?
Mm-Hmm?
Okay.
Oh
Let it go.
Yes
What do you want to say
Really?! Who?!
Did you prank Dwight?
Well
I love you
Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
Ryan
Oh
I move we sell!
Sell.
Hi
Oh
Im sure no one asked you to do that.
Listen
Michael
Michael
And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
Dont.
Yeah
Okay. Go Ahead.
Do you mind?
You dont have to do that.
Are you okay
Umm
Dwight
Im not going to do that.
Hi Nate
Hey
Sure.
Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with
An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
Dwight take it down.
Im serious
We can move out.
So
I went out to look for a better office space.
Not really
Yup.
Look at the huge offices Jim
Oh in three months we can. Check the lease
Theyre not of Cece.
This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
Well
Koreans.
White.
Parley?
So everyone here knows pirate code?
Youve been watering down the soap?
We need everything back the way it was.
Thats a sad story. I have another one. We move
I know
Uhh
Umm
Oh
Mmhmm.
I lied about some aspects of the building.
Theres no building... it doesnt exist.
I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. Its just this Office Administrator thing
Fail. I dont want to fail... again.
And thats what you said about Art School
Well
What?
Well thanks.
Hello
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two
Okay lets go in. Im freezing.
Okay
Okay.
Im freezing.
Im the office administrator now
It hardly looks fake. Its so lush.
Great.
Nope.
Nashua got mp3 players.
Before we kick off the party
A party. Its not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
Wow
Michael
I honestly think youre idealizing people here again
Hey.
Yes. But dont get too excited
Okay.
Ive been working forever on Jims present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. Hell take a memory or a private joke
No
Hey
Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. Its just us.
Oh
Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
Cool.
Hey
Okay. Sorry. Well uh
Hey
Maybe. I mean...
Um
Well Darryl
No
Bring her to the party. Yeah
Youll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
Hey guys
Who told you that?
Kelly! Um
You guys
Wow
It doesnt really seem like you.
So
Okay.
Okay
I mean
No.
Yup.
No
Look at this.
Jada
Oh
Something like an obstacle course
Thank you.
I dont think hes in the ceiling
Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?
Oh
I love it.
Oh
Michael
Thats good advice.
Thats a sad story.
Oh
I shouldnt tell you this
Really. And I dont know about you
So just be patient.
Hey
Oh... come on
Im sorry. I had no idea.
Oh
What?
What? What is it? What? What is
Hey
Its gonna be fun.
I recently met Sue
Oh
Hey
Why not?

Well
Angela.
Make time for romance!
I dont think so.
No.
Im not... Im not going to have...
No! Just talk to her.
Theres a plan.
The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Whos been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
Cool! Heres a little way to go gift from Sabre.
Creed. I noticed you dont have a resolution on the board. Whats yours?
How is it going?
One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact
Yeah.
But thats okay. Because its not about being perfect
Okay
Yes! Because with all of your support
You dont have to do that
Oh
Okay
Kevin
Yeah
Okay
Lesson learned.
Whats going on? Do you know that guy?
Jelp? J-e-l-p?
I dont think thats a word.
You want some help?
Mm-hmm.
K-a. Ka? What does ka mean?
No
I think theres better...
You could have just told us what you were thinking.
Theres no yelling in that
Oscar
I dont know. Theyre still in there.
Stop. Out with it.
Heres the story. That guy in there is Jims childhood friend
And when they were both in the third grade
And Tom...
And Jims mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group
Right. But howd you say it?
Wait. Can you back up? Whats the story?
Bye.

Im so sorry.
How much did you give him?
Wait. I dont have my scarf.
Im missing my scarf. Oh.
Yeah
Um
Yes. Never found that bottom
Yeah. What? Us?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Thats weird. I mean
You know
Oh
No
No.
That was so embarrassing. Im gonna die.
Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have s*x in the office.
Besides
No.
We took a walk.
Were all in it
Michael screened a work in progress for us
Wed love to see it!
Okay everyone
You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!
Looking at her mother on screen
Why is your face gold?
Im just making conversation.
I got Erin a new computer
Awwh
I just helped someone out. It feels good.
So you know the feeling.
Hey
Hes seriously awful!
United front...
You have a computer Andy.
Ok
Yes
See
Sorry Andy.
walking through the office
What? Erin is that true?
Erin
Im not freaking out
Andy
Switch the computers back Andy.
Seriously.
Now please.
I dont know if theres really a private place in this office.
You did that?
Okay.   When did people sign-
Well what was I supposed to do
Okay
Yeah
in a car with Andy
Andy
We should break this hinge maybe.
Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Yes
Yep. Lucked out.
Yep
Yeah. You know what
Three.
Im full on corrupt!
Hey Oscar
Oh.
Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans
Its cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
The signs will drive people inside.
Oh
Michael! Michael!
Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Why do you need more gas?
Is it a good message or a bad message?
Are you proposing!?
Wow.
Yea. Yea no problem.
Yep.
Michael
This is terrible.
You know what? Im gonna get a hose. Then well talk about it. Ok well figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Hey Michael everyones in the conference room.
You called the meeting I dont..
Michael.
We are a family.
And Ive always believed that we should all be involved in everyones personal lives
So about this proposal thing...
Michael
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that its safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didnt you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
Holy s*** is that real?
No shes going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Shes not gonna say no.
You were scared?
Congratulations!
Well
But
Cecelia.
Really? Oh
Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Hey
Da-das.
See
Whats going on?
Oh
Well the breadsticks are like what then
Youre right
Yeah...  they see Erin eating in her car
Whats wrong?
Why dont you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Dont you think its better to tell him the truth now? You know
What?
Wait
You didnt think to mention me huh?
Why?
Michael
Lets grab some ice cream
In costumes!
Whats wrong with cupcakes?
Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
We thought.
So this is the dream team.
Okay.
Should we get toppings?
What?
Hot fudge?
Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen
So Im going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Its a good shredder
Its not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
I dont think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
I dont
Okay
You know what
Oh

No he wasnt sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado
Good morning
Okay.
Because of the flowers.
Dogwoods
Hey
Okay.
Oh my God
I know.
Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Oh no
Oh wow
Look. Im juggling eggs and bowling balls. Im juggling with one hand. No hands.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?
Why dont you talk to him about it?
Why dont you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
So
So
Wow.
Jim
Just go in. Just go in
So one afternoon
Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun
Okay
Youre back in.
We could get Deangelo flowers.
What have you done?
Cant stay there all day.
Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Stop stalling! Come on.
You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Dwight
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
You shot a gun off -
What are we doing?
We need a new manager.
to Dwight
Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Its gorgeous
Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Thats not accurate.
How is this on me?
Hang up.   Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture.   Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Theyre the same picture.
The Senator?   He was married before
And dont say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Did you see him at a bathhouse?
The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Forget it. Im never gonna know what goes on there.
Youre in the gay mafia.
No.
Im a woman. I would want to know.
She does seem happy.
Okay.
Uh
Hello! This is... the client.
Yes.
Great.
Thank you
That was our dream wedding.
looks over at Oscar
A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
No
Ohh
in high-pitched
Well
I dont think I should.
Right here. Little Michael Scott-
Much different the second time around. And I have to say  it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
Wait
Well
Because everything makes me cry
Not enough though.
Jim.
If he comes out
He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
Maybe its a list of people hes gonna fire.
‘Scuse me?
I love you so much.
Okay.
Okay.
Thats regular pizza.
Oh
Oh
I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute
Oh. Oh God.
Yeah
Okay. Oh
Okay
Kevin
Yeah
No he hasnt.
Kevin
Kevin
Its huge. How much does it weigh?
Erin
Parenting? Yeah. This is Cicis favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
I flipped through it.
Of course.
Yeah.
That sounds nice.
I do.
Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points
Oh.
Yeah! Whoo!
Who talked to Maggie at Kaufmans?
Wheres Angela?
Ready!   Im not as think as you drunk I am!
Do Not Resuscitate...
Oh
We were hoping you could do something like this...
Baby.
Yes.
Do you think you could work from this?   we made some small adjustments.
Just a few adjustments
Um
Oh yeah
Angela
You know its just herbal tea.
Yeah. I think you should call social services.
You know
Fine.
Whats that come to? Like
Awesome.
And then on the weekends
I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
And then every morning
And then my handsome husband...
Would bring me a flavored coffee.
Well in your fantasy were Stephen King characters.
Oh
Wait
It says Lotto Pool
Oh come on. You really think Im gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
No.
Uh
You came in at 10:30 today
So. Ive been thinking
And we move to the south of France. See? No
Because Im never gonna act like that
We came to an agreement. Were going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
Just like now.
Oh..
What are you gonna do?
Andy
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
How is that better than a barbecue?
Nope.
Cece was around 22 weeks
Oh
Oh
I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert
What are they doing?
Nice touch.
Yeah.
faxing
Oh.  sends fax
Oh
Um
No
Yeah.
Oh
Okay. When I was 22
...and he said
Hey!
What do you mean?
I saw a ghost.
It was a ghost
I dont know what to tell you
Pam Halpert.
Is it called Ghostbusters?
It didnt look like that.
Ok fine Ill draw him.
Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?
Jim doesnt let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
Really.
Im not gonna freak her out
Im not gonna lie to her
Lets see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means Ive heard Closing Time a hundred and five times.   Still dont know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
I bet he went home.
What are you doing?
Uhm.
Yeah
Are you okay
Uh
Oh
Oh
No. Its a jokey saying. Pobodys nerfect
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
Im thinking cow-
Just dont talk about the email
Just trust me.
I got this.
Hahhh
Dwight stopped the device!
Hey Cathy.
Hows it going? Everything make sense?
Great.
Oh no
Ok   Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
Im training a temp to be my replacement while Im on maternity leave. Oh I shouldve mentioned Im pregnant. You probably didnt notice because its impossible to tell Im so small. But yeah Im pregnant.   Oh come on!
You doubt it?
Why do you doubt that shes single?
Its going to be good to have someone hot at Pams desk huh?
Im kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! Shes obviously super cute I get it. But Id like to point out theres 50 pounds more of me to love if thats your thing.
Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
Really well thank you all.
Hey.
Helen Mirren. Hot?
Huh. What about Cathy?
Yeah. Do you think shes hot?
Im not asking if youre in to her. Just
You dont find Cathy attractive?
Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
Yes
The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like youre a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird
Dwight
What about before? Was I attractive before?
Hmm. I think Jims lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
Yep
Okay.
I think so. Okay.
Well
Yep
Honesty is very important to me.
Lets just see how we feel when we get there.
Hmm.
Hey
I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
Mike Tibbets
Kelly
I dont think Jim cares about his hair.
Jims on to me.
Yeah
Yep.
No
Is he puffing out his chest?
No. Maybe he just said something funny.
I think hes just making her laugh.
Whys he making her laugh so much?
Why was he making her laugh so much?
Oh
Okay.
Oscar
Yeah?
Why wont you just admit that shes attractive? Its kind of annoying that you wont say it.
Well
Yeah
This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
Wait
Ah
Really?
Wait
Jim
Doesnt your dad have high blood pressure?
When was the last time you went to the doctor?
Dwight
Come on
Just go home. It doesnt matter.
Im gonna do it.
Oh! Im going into labor! Oh my goodness!
I know its wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things
: Im going into labor!
Im going into labor!
Im going into labor.
Here we go!
Okay.
Oh! Oh!
Im really in labor! This is happening!
Oh!
False alarm.
Here. Like it?
I cant get a fire pit. I have two babies.
Plants and- hi
Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as
Um
At this point
Hi. Wow
Oh right
Oh
Jim.
Hey.
Hi everybody!
How about a little visit?
Yes
No
Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play
No
No
She says no to everything. You know
No. Its crazy.
Shh.
Oh
Its okay
Shh.
Im looking
Okay

Why? Does he think youre going to Florida?
No
Well
I like it so far.
Its perfect. You emphasized the golf
Total golf text. Send it.

Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
I think you need to go to Florida.
Its only for three weeks
I was going to say good because Ill have all the help I need?
Exactly.
Alright
Bye. Call me when you land.
Hey

Well Im not the receptionist.
I know
Whoa
Hey
Well I know how it is. I know its a lot of fun. I dont know how it is. Andy
Guys

Hey Angela
Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Exactly. Unless you adopted
No
Angela is such a liar!
Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. Thats two sleep schedules
Yes
We are good to goooo!

Yes
Watson carpet and tile.
Hey
No
My husband would tell you to go for it.
Thats it
Thats true.
Weapons.
But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Thank goodness he was there.
Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
1-8-5-0-5.
I just had a baby.
Wow.
How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
Oh boy. Oh no
Aw
He said
Robert doesnt talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Did you actually try your hardest?
If Dwights about to get fired
Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Well find another receptionist. I mean
Hey
Aw
Aw.
This is Pam. Oh my God
Theres this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for
Well
Did a good job
What?
You messed up saying your name?
Robert
How can you give us performance reviews if you dont know us?
No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
I like working here.
Phyllis.
Really? Okay
Whoa
Well
No.
I think... youre a witch.
Im amazing.
Hey Jim. Stanleys back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
Its nice. Its funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Yeah he does.
Okay
Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Okay
Welcome back
Oh!
Um
Im sorry
Im still not sure why this woman is even here.
I know
Phyllis!
Hey
So were planning this party for Nellie
No. Were gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food
What?
Okay.
What? No! No
Oh
Or what if...
We discuss...   the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like
What are you talking about? Yes we can.
Okay
No
Cause theres someone already here named Pam.
Oh!  laughter
Thats not a real knot. When you pull on it
Hey Hank.
I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Yeah
Lets just- lets go.
Just one. This weather makes me want to stay at home
You know
Oh my gosh
Ravi
Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew theyd be good together.
Kelly has been a handful in the past.
But shes had a bad influence. Shes like an addict.   And I just had to get her clean.
Dont shake our baby?
Okay. Id never heard that before. So
Yeah
Yeah
I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Yeah
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask
Actually Andy
That a couple of times-
Okay
All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Fair enough. Um... I dont think youre a very good person. And forgive me
Oh
Read it
Read through the pain. Be strong.
Oh
Boo!
Barf! Ugh
Youre not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryans soul?
Kapoor and ka-desperate
He is a drifter out to sea.
Its just so dumb.   But when he describes himself as a child
Okay fine. Ryan
Smokey
No
I dont think you love Smokey Robinson. I think youre just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Oh my God
250 dollars is nothing to the worlds biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Tears of a clown!
Dwight
Oh
Sounds like youre doing alright.
Oh my god!
Whoa!
Are you-- Twice! For real?
Life is Downton Abbey.
Hm-hmm.
Or you proved that he thinks youre gay.
Well
Well
Absolutely
Yeah
What do you feed her?
Does she smell?
Oh
Um
Yeah
Why dont I help you now?
Okay.
So...what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean
Hey.
I stole Nellies phone.
What do you want from me?
Sounds like it.
Okay
No
Robert! Okay
Ah. Ahh.
Hey.
Um... yes. Definitely. With your hair –
Certainly. Um... you dropped your cell phone.
Yep.
No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
No
Well –
But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals.
No... dont. Just put it out of your mind.
I know
Family picture!
What? Honey
Yes
No
We decided that theres no way Dwight would harm a child.
No
But its free. And well keep our eye on them.
Yes!
And well make sure Dwight doesnt do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Yeah?
Okay.
Oh
Okay.
You ready?
There we go.
Ill just stand here?
See? That wasnt so hard.
You hit her?
Oh
But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
David
For us
Kay
Yes
And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
He said if it takes off hes gonna buy us a new car.
And that was our summer.
Dont you guys have everything. I mean
Oh
Dwight!
What are you doing?
I will?
Sure
No.
Dwight
Exactly the way it is.
Yes
Find someone else
You ready?
Kay.
The buildings custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So
Well
No
‘Kay.
Yes
I dont think you guys understand why were doing this. Its-
Ive been through several rounds of development with the team and heres where we stand with the chore wheel.  introducing a third ‘chore wheel
The tiny wheel actually does have chores. Its so cute no one seems to mind.
Toilets!
Thanks
Yeah. Im afraid hes only gonna have hot dogs.
Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
Think so.
Thank you.
Yes
Whos that?
Ha-ha.
No. Roy? No.
We still surprise each other.
You know
Yes. But
In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean
Tell me one thing about you I dont know.
And you thought you guys were millionaires.
Yes. But theres
Thought you were millionaires
Uh-huh.
Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
Johnny Depp.
I think maybe there actually is something I dont know about Jim.
OK. Well
I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didnt tell you because
Yeah
Just tell me.
Jim
Jims at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
. Is everything okay?
Great.
Nellie
Im sorry
You know
Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama
What?
Sure.
So hes not related to Michelle Obama?

Nellies pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.

Yeah—turn signal. Its exciting to be painting again—those are the wipers. So—the—its—just. There you go! Yeah.   Yeah
Well
Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
Good. Very good.  Oh—no! Here. Its
Oh
Oh—gee—Im—
Brilliant!
Ummm. Oh! Ill say hes related to Richard Nixon. Its an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
Im sorry. Its just
Jim? No.
Because he just loves me too much.
Good. Good. And—
So what did you want to show me?
Yeah. Its really ugly
You mean me?
Oh my god! I love it! Uh
What?! No! I-I got this.   Okay?
I still cant believe he didnt tell me.
I was helping Nellie drive—
Thank you.
Week off. Thatd be great.
Oh
A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
Yeah
Whats this?
Its OK. You know what they say
Oh my god! Ah!
You know what? Its fine
Oh! Yes!  Group cheers
My name is Pam.
I like to paint.
You think youre better?
Oh no you aint!
Hey
No
Then why isnt he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
Hey honey
Phyllis! Thats not safe.
Go up and check on him. Hes upset.
Please? Just make sure hes OK?
Oh!   Hey! Howd it go?
Yeah?
You feel OK now?
Well

Oh my god. Im getting so stuffed.
You did it.
Role call.
Hey.
I am Dr. Cinderella.
Im an oncologist and you are a dog.
So the sports marketing business that Jim told everyone about except for me?
Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
Yeah
You were in an a capella group?
Yeah. I mean
I kind of am. Its crazy.
Okay.
Okay I give up. What are you?
Gross. I love it.
Hey
Did you end up investing?
How much?
About ten?
Wow.
Wow.
No yeah. Yeah.
So did everybody ...
Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
What?
They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
Talk about it now.
Jim
We said some. We said ‘some.
We said part not all.
Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
No Im just
No! No
Yeah
Andys family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way hes been handling it is just..so..
Right?
Oh
Nope
Oh
Hes gonna be disappointed.
Please hold for Ms. Black.
Good afternoon Iris
No the papers not toxic.
Unless its exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
Andy.
Can you go instead?
Youve got this Schrute.
Oh
Hello
Okay

Huh.   Uh huh.
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
Nellie
Ten years ago
You know
Dwight
Okay
Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
Like
Oh
Okay
Oh my God. Its Jan.
Jan used to be one of my superiors
Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks
Forget everything we taught you. Hey
What?
Sorry. Um
So this was all just a trick. You dont really have any business to give?
But not to us.
You did good
What?
Yeah.
Yeah. Um
Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
And it is so cute how she signs her name.
Oh
Oh
Of course.
Um... A... X? I dont -- you got me.
Im so sorry. I hate this. Youre better.
Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
Oh
Okay
Oh
Dwight
Thats a license number?
Oh. Why me?
These are my painting clothes.I think Im gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.
Are you avoiding your phone call?
Last week Jim wasnt there
Tell them your opening line.
I think its good. He likes fishing.
I guess if I make a mistake
Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that...
Its probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
I could get us a complaint.
No
Hello
Basically I couldnt tell
I-- I thought they were confused at least...
I did not know that.
Im so sorry.
If youre an artist
Shut up
Im sure its fine. its a blue shirt.
Im on it.
Were the party planning committee
Yes! Phyllis!
What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
The party planning committee
Dwight
And that is...
That there are no rules.
Youre welcome.
What is it?   Dont touch it.
Oh!
I feel like  --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
And the fear.
Wow.
Mouse trap.
Oh
Well...this is it.
Shut up. Im trying to be serious.
I cant believe this is actually happening.
Okay.   Good luck. Youre gonna be great.
Okay.
Love you.
Whats going on?
For what its worth
I dont think anyone thought that.
Well
Zero.
Dwight

Jims been spending a few days a week in Philly and Im not gonna lie
Great. Everythings great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
Oh
Good luck!
Love you.
Hey Meredith
He didnt leave me. He just went part time.   Can you just fill out the form please?
Im sure shes just confused. People scratch their heads when theyre confused. Not always like an ape
Dwight
Stop that!
Alright
No! How? Im so clean!
Guys
Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So lets not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine
Hey
Oh my God
Oh stop! I am so sorry!
Nothing.
I am going to tell her
Shes right
Oh! Uh
No
Okay.
Oh
Hes really making you work for it
Great. I am killing it over here.   Jim
Hey
Creed
Well
Hello?

You guys
Is there a volume knob on that thing?
Meredith
I meant to say something earlier. I just...
Hey honey
Im just gonna go home. My moms been watching the kids all day.
Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
Meredith
I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean
Get it

A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens
Okay
You ready for your interview?
Well
Really
Good!
I just wanted to see you!
Wow
Sure
Thats sweet that he talks about me.
Well
Theyre the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. Its like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over
Say they dont hire you. Its not like youre out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
Right? Thank you! Its just Philly. Everyones acting like its New York or Paris or London.
Not us.
Congratulations.
I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
No
Everybody dance now...
Hey... What happened here?
...Are the pens here?
: Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
You dont remember?
Theres nothing down here.

Yeah
I dont think so
Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So
Yes. Thank you. Lets answer that question.
What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isnt just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Dont you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
Sure did. I was as surprised as you
No
You will?
Thank you.
Yeah?
Great.
I was hoping for a righteous mob
We need another approach. Um
See
Tell us who defaced the mural!
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
Maybe
Well
What was that?
Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
That sucked. He didnt apologize. Theres no talking to that guy.
We should just take him down.
Im saying we should go scorched earth on that guys face.
Yes!
Yes!
We need an infiltrator.
Clark?

Aw
Oh
Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.

OK.
Oh?
Are you sure?
Yeah.

Todd

So
Kevin
Yes. He was a good spy.
Guys
Wait!

Good morning
Hey
Phyllis!

I mean
He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point
I feel like hes always making these decisions for the family
Im sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I dont want him to do it anymore
I didnt see you! You should have yelled Crossing!
Ok
Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
So
And we have homework.
And were also supposed to speak our truths.
Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly
Hey!
Oh
Well
Oh
I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
Well
Uh
Really? Ive been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth
Were not high.
I wish wed started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
Ok.
Jim!
Alright
Bye.
I love you.
Its great.
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Nice morning
Wow.

When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time
Question.

Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Darryl
Cool
Aha. Hows Athlead?
Wow.
He says he doesnt want to.
Well
Thats what he says.
Hey.
Are you happy?
No
And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
What about five years from now?
Because Im so glad youre back
Okay.
I kind of forced you to do it.
Yes
Im afraid that youre gonna resent me and Im afraid that—
This is not enough for you and Im afraid that Im not enough for you.
He does have a gift.
What is this?
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Whats that?
Thank you.
What? Dwight
Well
Angela
I think she looks good. Now that shes wearing sports bras

Darryl

Uh
Whoo-hoo...go
No
Well
Im sorry. Is there a question?
Oh
Listen
Yeah
Oh
Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
Oh
He just so happy to have a family plan.
Is it me? Is it Nellie?
I need to get out of this dress.
Why are you still here?
Okay
About 2 months
Yeah.
Well
Austin? Maybe.
Im doing it for us.
Hold on a second.   Wait
I wanna do this.
I really want to do this!
Were so excited.
Uh
Everyone
Okay.
Dunder Mifflin
I didnt watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes
What about the honeymoon?
I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing...
And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. Well come back to visit. But I think its time for us to officially...
Thanks Dwight.
I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all...I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. Theres a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isnt that kind of the point?
