Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?
I like that.
Good-looking group.
Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?
I thought this guy was the manager?
Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!
Yeah. I think I understand.
Each of you is doing half a job.
This is knucklehead talk. Im not gonna bite it

You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do
Fine. I dont care which one of you does which job

Not long ago
Can you now?
Its a little form

Why dont you come with me? Well start out with the honcho
When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing
So say we catch this whistleblower
Uh
Well
Yeah.
Okay Dwight.
Well
Yeah
I dont like to tell a man what to do with his money
Well
Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
And we didnt find anything on your computer.
Except this.
I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. Im just curious
The way I look at it
Michael.
Michael Scott... what do you know?
If it doesnt matter
Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem
Hahahahahaha.
Michael.
Lets just talk.
Honey
Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Oh
Whos Holly?
When I was growing up

The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth
: Now listen here
Now
Ive always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles
Hey
Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Well
Dwight! Walk me out. Lets talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - its nice to have a little power
What?!
Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? Its not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
Beaumont-Adams is a girls gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Who else would be responsible?
Oh
I love you
No
You three are my search committee. Youre in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Till then
Who is it?
Gabe
Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Ohh
Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion
Paper material?
Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Ill interview you right now.
Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Yeah
Okay.
Welcome to Scranton
Huh?
No
I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question.   If he isnt here in sixty seconds...
Lets just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
All that for this job.
Thats f***ing crazy.   Get outta here.   What a nutjob.
Okay
Whos this fella? Went to Cornell. Whats wrong with him?
And thats your unbiased opinion.
So its not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Lets get you back to Florida. Well figure out something for you.
Its not. Lets get Kelly in here to take his place.
Cause Gabes tall and weak. Shes short and strong. Im doing an opposites thing.
Howd my girl Nellie do?
She didnt mention it?
Integrity move. I like it.
Well
