So what does downsizing actually mean?
What?
Well
I was just going to say
Yeah?
Well
Oh

Id like to play if its just for fun. I played basketball in school.
I have a sports bra.
Ill do it.
Live and learn.

Dwight
What were you doing in the ladies room?!
Why were you peering over the stalls?!
You are a pervert!
You
But where would we...go?
This says Bushiest Beaver.
Its
All relationships? Eh
Im the same age as you
Were in the same High School class.
Michael! Come on!
You dont have to worry. Im not going to...
...report you to HR.
Ill do it.
Are you calling me a ho?
Oh
Oh
Um
Definitely Jim.
Come on
Yeah
Thats great!
What are you? A monk?
Ass.
Thats the characters name?
Sir
Theyre important.
First message is : I love you. Thats from me.
Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.   Tom?   Pow.
Sure.
You tell me. Well
Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road Ive ever known...
Dwight...
Yes
Im sorry
I knitted it for you.
Hi guys.
Does everybody know my boyfriend
Where are we going this afternoon?
A furnace?
What does the furnace do?
Michael
Michael
Um
Oh
Youre gonna compete against us?
Im good at computer stuff
I dont know. I thought that I wasnt going to be asked that...
Really? I thought they were pretty...
...and a big walk-in closet.
Shes real good.
Im excited about today.   I love girl talk.
Mistake.
That must have been hard.
Mmmm
Isnt he sweet?
Really
Goodnight Pam.
Hey
Oh.
Unbelievable.
Its unbelievable!
When should we bring out the cake
Where do we get those?
Yes
Its labeled.
We dont feel that way.
Oh I got the Save The Date.
Yeah
Uh
Okay...
Excuse me.
No
Stanley and I are close
I know you keep saying its your space
I guess so...
I dont like you.
But I didnt report your snoring-
Oh
Afghani.
Afghani.
Okay
Oh
I have an ace.
Oh
Look
You guys wanted to see me?
Well
$14.
$3
It will never happen again. My boyfriend
Okay.
Im getting married to Bob Vance.
No
Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
You should order the most expensive thing on the menu
Oh
Woooooow.
Its really something.
Youre kidding...
Michael
Maybe Ill quit.
Thats a shame. Ed was a good guy.
Okay thats enough.
Well
Im just saying hi to Bob.
Whats on your suit?
Ok
Isnt this fun? Not wearing shoes?
Hey guys. Uh
I thought maybe DJs.
Okay
We know the branch is closing  Michael told us.
Stanley!
Hey
I was...
Ill tell you later.
What smell?
Oh
What is it?
My perfume?
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. Its made from real pine.
You have a lot to learn about this town
Oh
Bob Vance has an air pump. He said hed fill all our tires up.
I cant feel my toes.
I like goose. If its already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
But we invited guests.
I thought you said green was whorish.
Itll be all right.
You should
I was just getting a snack.
OK.
Hi.
Oh
Cold
Maybe thatll help. Is it cold in there?
Theres another party in the break room.
Oh
I called every grocery store in Scranton
Were the same age and Ill pick... Karen.
Then how is this Amazing Race?
Michael.
Do you have a pole?
Um-hmmm.
Its a big order. Thanks Kenny.
Hey
Yeah
Im so glad youre with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
You can pay me back later for the makeover.
Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
No. Sorry.
Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
Yes
Thanks
Yes
No.
That wasnt me.
I thought it was...
Michael... No.
I dont need your... thank you. No
I do.
Thanks Angela.
I dont have that
Its beautiful. Why dont you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
Its fish.
You found Uncle Al!
Thank you
Look
Did you see...
Mm-hmm
Four.
I know
I think I just got flashed.
In the parking lot.
Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over
I didnt really get a good look.
Michael.
When I got my hair cut short
Oh
She does have very nice clothes.
No
I bet you know. Dont think
My mom taught me that.
Jims gonna love it.
Is there any mustard?
What are you gonna do?
Dwight is our new boss.
I think its gonna be Michael.
No
You shot Dwight?
Does it hurt terribly?
Im a Lutheran and Bobs a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
Oh
You guys are together?
Did you plan it?
Michael...
Sorry
I couldnt see your hands.   Hey Pam
OK.
Wait
Did you even try?
I cant see half of the things.
Michael.
This is stupid.
How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
Did you get any clients back?
Stanley
Angela is worse than usual lately
So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
Im so sorry to hear that
I want to understand what youre saying but its difficult for me when you use that tone.
Yes.
You can pick one of these things. Its unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.

That seemed to shut her up.
Yeah
Hes always been terrible with money.
Dancing babies!
Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. Shes doing a book signing right now.
Okay.
Bye everyone.
Well
So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
No.
Popcorn.
Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn.
Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once.
Michael wasnt invited on Ryans camping trip. Toby went
Oh!
Hey
Do you have any idea what time well get out of here?
Call us when you get there so we know youre OK.
Michael?
I have a friend whos single.
Sandy. Shes gorgeous and shes got a feisty personality
Umm
Umm I dont know Michael.
What are you asking?
No
Well
Did the police solve the problem with the...
Elliot.
Jim was supposed to collect it.
We-- we--
Well--
When I was a little girl...
We-we found some wet cement in the park...
In our neighborhood...
What did we write?
Thats the dumbest thing I ever heard.
I mean
What consequences?
Yes.
Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Thats right. Yeah.
They make you feel lighter...
Okay.
Oh boy. I appreciate your help
Why would you do that?
Really?
Hello Angela.
Can I get a list of your vendors?
Why would you do that?
Sorry.
Kevin
Sorry
Hey
Party plannings a real high. Like a runners high.
Thats despicable.
Thats...
Go get him Bobby!
Sic him!
Sic him!
Hey
Thought we were playing for fun.
But its closer to you.
Oh
Phyllis
Oh.
I like your frames.
Oh
Well
Jim
I dont know
When I was growing up
And if the food stations are here and here... no! Here and here. Drinks here
Mmm
Its times like these
Angela
Yes
Its going well.
We lost weight today. I think its OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
Stanley
You said fruit
Cake.
Yes you were.
Split the commission?
storms in the office
There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
You left me in a bad part of town!
Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
Why should I have to thank him?
I like her purple dress.
I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
Thank you
I dont care what shes doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.
No.
That cant be right.
Hey
I know
Look at it as if youre paying for the cake
I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. Im no longer under Angelas heel
Sorry.
What are you making?
Youre making a knife with a knife?
You want to talk about it?
You know I know.   You know they know.
Hi.
Its nice to learn new things.
Okay.
What dont you get?
Angelas not really a risk taker. And Andys not really a risk.
No
Where are we going?
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
I think its a fun idea.
We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
Move on
Its the only gavel I could find.
Oh dear.
Why couldnt have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
Now you move on.
Well Dwight
Well
I have my hug.
Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
Mm. I like your shoes.
Sure.
Im sitting right here Dwight.
On more week.
Dwight
Jim
Wheres your place?
Ohhh...
Hello.
Know what?
Im sorry. Its the largest one I have.
This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is Nights in Morocco. This isnt your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course shes from Morocco
Yes.
Angela. Youre going to move this for the party right? Its not on theme.
Alright. You can keep your camel
I need you to get rid of the tree.
Thank you.
Oh
It looks like were going to be here for awhile
And napkins... fanned.
I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate.   I dont think theyre appropriate anymore.
Oh
You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why arent you wearing the hairnet?
Ok... nice.
Thats a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan.
I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
I didnt ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be.
Excuse me?
Okay.  starts to walk away
Wow
Why isnt Dwight turning around?
Andys running over Dwight with his car.
Dwight
Youve got no taste Stanley Hudson.
Hillary Swank.
Shes not hot.
What--
Oh! I forgot my purse.
What in the name of God is going on?!
Thats not a good idea
He needs to rest.
We bury him?
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
Let me get you some water.
Hey
I hope hes ok
Oh
You forgot her birthday
Shes out of your league Andy.
Sexually?
Theres always a theme.
Hey
It is so nice to go out with another couple.
I know
Hes talking about Michael
Okay. Now everyone here whos bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Come on
Yes I do.
Bowling.
Oh sure
Yeah
Damn.
Oh
Its just me here.
I think he left.
Um
Andy Hes gone.
You dont have to kiss his ass anymore.
I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
No
Its really cute.
Whats wrong with you?
I think you look nice.
You sound worried.
Andy
Mm-hmm.
Maybe
You mean the clients you stole from us.
It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Well
Isnt that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didnt have enough time for them?
Close your mouth
You dont take my clients away and give them to a secretary.   No offense
Those sound too harsh.
A restaurant.
Ryan
Me.
Michael
Michael
Michael
Michael
Work.
Its a combo dance house coffee bar.
Aw
Oh
Tell him Im going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Mmm-hmm.
Hi.
Hey. I like.
Oh! Mother ******!
Back!

Wow! Sorry!
Its my back.
Call a doctor.
No. Call Bob.
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight! Dwight!
I do.
That feels good
An hour? I cant stay here an hour.
But the rattlers so scary.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.
When I say it out loud its so silly.
Wanna dance
Weve been out here for a while. I dont need this.
Oh
Ow
I... twisted it.
Theyre not getting married. Its just talk.
Theres nothing to know
Teris out of town
Teri
How far along is Pam?
We have a right to know.
Congratulations!
Again with the cousin.
Whats happening to you Michael?
Whats going on?
Hey
Perfect. I hate registries.
My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldnt tell you
Good. Good.
This isnt a game
Not according to the beans.
Its not so much that I might not get a raise. Its just demeaning!
Yeah
I say no.
Michael!
Come on! This isnt fair!
Michael
Now this is getting ridiculous.
Thats funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.
I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldnt be a good wife.
So he wont get caught!
Disgusting...
Good luck Michael
Wow. Sounds scary.
Michael
And when you fell in
Michael
So now youre comparing yourself to a cute
Michael. You know
Were not mocking
Well
Yes. Put the DVD in.
This is really nice Dwight
Holy crap.
It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy.
You know
What does that mean?
Michael
Well
Lose the twirl.
Yeah
Bob took me to Capellos. We got a little tipsy.
Oh
Its not like you can fire people or anything.
Ryan.
Sorry. Plastered.
Whats Scotts Tots?
Yeah
Thats fair.
How is that possible? No offense Pam
Ooh.
You didnt decorate it?
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! Its me
Yeah!
I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament
Its going to be a very jolly time if youve been good!
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
Yeah.
Well?
The only Santa.
You promised me this. Dont make me get Bob involved!
Never mind
How do you know its a gun?
In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today
All right sweetie
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! Youve been very good this year -
And this brings us to you
Its a secret.
Hi Michael.   Mm. kay.
What?
An Xbox it is. Because Ive decided youre a good boy.
No Bob
Im sorry
Im really sorry. It was earlier today.
Hi sweetie.
Im good baby.  they kiss
Michael
I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication Im on.
No.
I did.
You dont even like us as friends?
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
No
Good luck!
This is ridiculous. We just cant wait here.
But you dont know that. I mean
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Hey!
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Honey
Finally
What are you -
What the hell do you think youre doing?
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
What are these for?
Michael
I think youre remembering that wrong?
I dont know about this. I mean
Whats the least we can do to make this okay?
I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Oh
Okay
So how about
Yeah
Our treats
Yuck. Im not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Ten...
Eleven
One more
Hmmm
Yeah
Hey
Say Me eat cookie.
Mm-hmm.
I dont get it.
You dont know that. Some people cant help oozing sexuality.
She just crossed her arms together... thats bad.
Michael
Oh
I dont think hed do that.
Oh Michael.
Hey!
Was there a fistfight?
And it didnt change your mind.
Michael
Yes.
For your signature.
Awww
quietly
Look
I dont know
You deserve it.
Dwight!
Luke? Luke!
Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didnt get em.
Yeah
Hey
Well
Yep
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
Im glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues
Go get em Dwight.
Its nice
Found him!
Your show was really great
Oh
Yeah
God! Wow!
Thats no pimple Michael.
Oh! When you got your new phone
The ability to express love physically. Its a magical thing.
What? Is Dan okay?
Yes.
Oh
You know
I could try to seduce him.
Uh...
This is weird.
Its not gonna get better  hes gonna steal all of our clients.
I dont know
I think he-
Oh.
What should we ask?
An asset!
Who takes a kid to Mexico?
Church isnt a party
Michael
Okay
Heres her carrier
Whos that?
Whos that?
Which ones Glee?
You know your perfumes!
Are you alright?
I know. I thought you two were nice together.
Made love? I dont know.
Ill see what I can find out.
Erin! Uhm
And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
Of course you dont wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didnt even make love
Magical...
You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
What do we do? How do we stop this?
Yeah
Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
I am jumping.
Yes
Yeah
Oh God.
Oh
Whats the case
So is it an open relationship?
Nobody cares about that. Look
So you went homemade this year.
Yeah. Money problems
Are you good at homemade?
Yeah...
Well
I think its good.
I know Sue. Shes not that great. And you know her husbands in a wheelchair
Ill talk to her
Why wouldnt she?
Follow my lead. Hey
Oh
No.
So
You didnt break up with AJ at all? I mean
A lot of mines in Scranton.
Im out too.
Hmm?
Wow.
C.C
Im clicking!
I am clicking.
Well
Yes.
Yeah
Maybe thats not the best one. Keep reading.
No
Yeah
Blue Wasabi is so good
Mm-hmm.
Yeah
If youre just handing them out
Yeah mostly.
It didnt go down so easy but shes made some friends and its already better than it was.
Uh I dont know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says I cant take care of myself anymore its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if youre interested.
Yeah
Mmm
I love their breadsticks!
I have diabetes too. You dont see me making a big deal about it.
in the conference room with Pam
The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Yeah that was a surprise...
Please Michael.
I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Look Michael
Its almost done
Its cute.
What does that even mean?
Do you believe that?!
Hmm
As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes
Yeah
You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
No.   Im on a sale!
Okay...
Theyre almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Oh no
Here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Im not a feminist
Thats true.
He means the ice pack.
You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Hows your hearing?
Okay
Good morning.
Did you have a nice drive in?
Oh
It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
But
Mm.
Yeah.
Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in
Bestiality. Yeah.
If my daughter were asking me...
I would say
I dont think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
You know
Is it true that youre making Dwight the manager?
He and Kelly said
Yeah.   Yeah
No
It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Then what was this all about?
Yeah
Ahhh!
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
Thanks guys.
Cmon
Yeah
Completely.
Well
Whew
Good night
Ooh
Andy
Wait....theyre terrified?
Yeah
You dont have to thank us for coming in
Ask for Donald
What else you got?
Thats still a lot of money!
Yeah.
What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
Andy
No..we dont
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Why didnt you just say this was to impress Robert California?
Who?
Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
Wait
I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
Is she Asian?
Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriends from the forest?
Hmm.
Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
We did our best.
Yeah you have this sexy glow.
No were not.
Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
Well
Im in too.
Ooh. Isnt that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
Yeah
I dont think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal
We have a gym at home. Its called the bedroom.
Aw... Hes so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
Is that ladle stainless or...
One
You know
Is that Cici?
Thats awful.
Dwight?
He should pay.
What?
Backups.
Oh I know you think that
Well
Oh
Then another woman will get it. We cant allow that. We have to destroy it.
How was jury duty?
Did you send him to the slammer?
Oh
Yeah
Yeah.
Why?
Im sorry
Cookies?
Oh.
No
Just go.
Are you glad to be back?
I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
Eight Cases
If I wanted Jamaican food Id just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Ooh
No way.
Do you have a black eye?
Look
If Dwights not coming back
Yeah.
Oh.
Make them kiss each other.
What are you doing?
Hey! Good to have you back.
Yeah.
Nellie
Pam.
Really?
Oh
Oh
He does have a moustache.
I cant believe hes making us throw a party for her.
It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
On purpose.
Order carrot cake.
Toots
Welcome to your party.
Whoo! Wow
Oh
Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Oh
I actually sleep better when its raining.
What do you mean?
Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
I mean
If it makes you feel any better
Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done.
How do you? I mean
Yeah
Whats he doing?
Oh.
Yeah.
Is it true youre buying the company?
So were not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
Helpless.
Who was Pams first celebrity crush?
You think that Andys family owned slaves?
Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
Andy
Whats going on?
Oh my god!
Oh
Just drive away. Just..
Role call.
Dont you have any sunblock?
No
Dwight
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ‘gy-na for your entire meeting.
Yeah
Guys
So
Okay
No
No actually
Oh
Ms. Thomas
Oh
Okay
Yeah.
How much wine do you have?
You know what? I dont know where the years went.  ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands
Whose hands are these?   Theyre not my hands. I dont know.
No. Jim...
No
Can you help me?
ha ha!
Got it.
Were gonna cover for you
Yeah
Of course we are
I knew the party was today
We already said no.
Lets do it!
Dwight said its Hog maw.
Its the lining of the stomach of--
Come on
Thank you
Oh. What are these?
Id rather have the bowl.
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink
What are you wearing?
You got dumped?
Whats gonna make you feel better
Mmm
Val.
Well
We think you made a big
Hes a real catch and you should take him back.
I have ears
Clark!
Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now thats Italian.
What?
Hey
We dont work for you!
Wait. This says Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge?
Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend
Well
David Wallace called this meeting?
Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your   boyfriend. But
Oh...
Ah
Andy.
He and Pam are having their Valentines Day lunch.
We started selling balloons.
I cant be around sad people
Andy
Andy!
What does that even mean?
Put it down.
Put it down
See?
Told you so.
Come on Andy
Ow
It looks pretty black.
Why are you here
I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so theyre dense. But
So
OK. Packer can go to hell.
I dont care what you do
Last night
What did you do
Why?
What the hell?!
Wait
Play it again.
Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didnt know it?
I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
What does it say?
Ouch. Sorry
No
Her hair looks beautiful.
Yeah. Poor Angela.
Andy sings beautifully. And hes really good at dancing. Hes a good speaker. But theres just something there you dont want to look at.
Whats it now
Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. Hes not terrible.
No
Ill try this one.
Hot!
Were all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then hes gone for who knows how long.
Which thing?
Hit it
Yeah
Oh
Thanks.
Oh
After 16 years
. Andy...
Andy
Poor
Angelas special repairman is here.
Its just the wind.
Okay.   Its just the wind
Let me help you us.
Oh
I missed you.
Lots of people think that Stanley Hudsons a mean old grump.   But   would a grump make this? Its me. Its me.
Cool.
Hey
Im happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
