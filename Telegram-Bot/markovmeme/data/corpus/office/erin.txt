Oh. Did we come up with a new name?
Cool.
And Im the minister.
Rolling?  Kelly inhales the cigarette
Is that a wrap?
Absolutely.
Good.
The shoot was going really great... until Kelly and Ryan got into a fight. Then the poop really hit the fan.
Maybe you can do it alone?
Do you know someone?
Would you be able to kiss him?
Oh. No. You have to wipe the jelly off your hands first. Sticky.
Hes your replacement.
They do have sparks.
Amazing!
Kelly got Andy to edit it for us in exchange for a small part.
You are so talented.

Kelly has an eating disorder?
She always eats my lunch.
We should do something.
I am so happy youre eating again.
I heard it from Michael.
Thats really great
Michael
I think hes around here...
David Wallace is calling.
Should I tell him youll call him back?
Dwight
David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.  Michael and Jim leave
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So
Oh no. That wouldnt be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
Oh. Gross.
Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Oh yeah. What else you got?
What else you got?
Are you in a lot of pain?
People say you cry all the time.
If you want to sit on this--   I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged pen1s. Make it softer.
Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Michael walks in office
In your schedule it just says nine til noon is creative space and I thought this could be part of that.
You dont have anything in the afternoon. It just says free play.
Yes?
Okay.
Okay.
How do you return coffee?
Theyre back!
Hi!
Coco Leche! Thats my favorite!
Oh
I think it will too
Oops
Sure. Oh
Pam
Michael

They said the both of you.
Youre soaking wet.

Naughty Nellie Nutmeg

Hello.
Sounds like a plan
Well
Yeah
I havent seen it.
Of course
Where are you taking me?
Savannah? Thats a far way from Scranton.
No.   Did you?
I thought it was for real. So I was excited
Wallace is on the phone. Hes returning your call.
I dont think so. I think its David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
Michael? The limos here for you.
He said limousine
Its like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
Frankies Dirty Joke of the Day? Theres a bunch of those.
Theres a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say Delivered. Should I delete all of those?
Thats why you have a Sent Mail folder.
Theres about 30 news alerts for Nip Slip.
Nip slip.
Well...
Oh
Hey Pam
Oh
Weve already rescheduled seven times.
I can print out a new itinerary with Pams name on it.
Wow!
Youre famous.
Hey Mr. Scott

The principal told me that 90% of Scotts Tots are on track to graduate
Really?
Ive always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
Yes
Seriously?
Hello. Sorry guys.  louder
Its so edgy!
It stings a lot.
I keep trying to figure out whos sending me these gifts.
So far no one will admit to it.
Is it you?  Andy stage face
Seriously?
What?
Do you want me off the call too Michael?
It was a little much Andy.
What were you thinking?
I got a big box
Guys
Well
I think when Andy finally asks me out hes going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I cant wait to see what he comes up with.
No
Nothing. Its wide open.
Uh-oh
Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
Oh
You named them?
Uh
Wow
Andy
Michael
Well
You know
Whos hungry?
Its ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2:30 and say Whos hungry?
Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
Its a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving
Oh sure.
Well.
Geez louise.
Well
Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
Its no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I cant compete with her. That girl can sing
Yeah
Sure does! Okay
Oh!  hits another key
Ooh

Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
Um
Okay

I didnt know we had a tape measure.
You wanted to see me?
Oh
I dont know what to say.
Okay.
Michael
Im so sorry if I gave you the impression Im into Kevin

Really?
I dont want anyone to die.
Hi.

Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
And

Well...
Okay

Everyday is fine. Or...

Okay.
Welcome back
Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!

Well...
Opens door
Im in my jammy-jams!
Oh
Your hands cold.

Yes. Thank you
Im so sorry I was so sick.
Something came for you
Yeah. I basically wish you were dead.   I hid the leads.
mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key

Exactly.
Quiet.
Whats this game?

Okay.
Erin sits with man
What we said to do.
I was flirting with a man.
The movies. I dont know.
You love drama.
Oh
Thank you.
Welcome back!
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Well
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworths.
Just the two of us.
Yeah
Oh.
Okay.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
I would have chosen the 1490s.
Cause America was discovered.
And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell
Yeah
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Hes the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Yeah I love that.
What?
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Why wouldnt he tell me that?
They had s*x?
Uhhhh
face looks disgusted
moans
In the Foster home
breathes heavily
Lunch was fine.
I dont know. It was lunch
God
I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
I dont want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didnt know?
Who are you?! I dont know you!
Thanks.
You want to talk to me
Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Really?
It was Andy
I hope you find what youre looking for.
Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? Whats your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
How long were you guys together?
A year? You were together for a year?
I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?

Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
I cant trust Andy anymore.
Its Andys fault.
Oh
You tricked me!
Buenos dias
Holy cow. Id be so happy.
I know. I meant Id be happy for them.
Mm!
Michael
Yeah.
Oh
Great.
Kelly got into the minority training program.
Maybe youd be more comfortable in your own office.
Uh
Yeah.
Its so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Do you want me to go back to the store?
This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
After his last breakup
Thats okay. You probably shouldnt keep a baby up that late
We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Hes coming.
Hi Michael.
Thanks
What about Kelly?
Is this a joke?
Ryan
Andy?
I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Yeah.
Im Just the Girl Next Door is our best song ever. Your voice just keeps getting better.
Its the economy.
Oh. It was so much fun being famous
Oh good.
Thats so cool Kevin.
Weve got our outlet.

Im so sorry Angela.
grunting
Not somebody. Parts from many!

Whack!


Yes
Whos the guy who invented the peanut?
Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God hes my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didnt have to
Thats a really tight argument.
Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
Oh my gosh
Im sorry
Yeah!
I dont know.
Dwight  snaps a picture with a disposable camera
Disposable cameras are fun
Andy?
Did you write this?
Who did?
Who is he?
I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe cant come. Sorry.
Oh
Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
I really wanted to see Andys play
I just didnt think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
Im sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable
Oh
Why dont I just take her home and let you guys finish
Okay. Alright
Yes. Oh

Oh
They caught the Scranton Stranger
Its pronounced wacko.
Michael!
Gabe and I are having a party
Yeah its a TV show...
Uhh. Its just that its our first party together so...
Okay
Wait which one?
Good me too!
I dont know if Michael likes Gabe that much
Mhmm! Id love it if you were there.
You and Michael are always the life of the party!
Why would I keep you from coming?
Why would I hide it!
Its make your own pizza night. Isnt Gabes place so nice?
Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
Those posters used to be real French ads.
The shows starting. The shows starting! The shows starting! Shows starting!
I wasnt recording it.
Wait
Jim.
Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket
Look who I found!
Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks
Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
Whats the longest thing youve ever seen?   For me it was the tale from Jets.
Are you having a good time?
Andy you look awful!
Are you alright?
Oh
I dont know.
I have to go Phyllis.
You did this?
Why dont you like him?
I care if you like him.
Okay...
What?
Uhm

I hate your roof!
Ill raise it how I want! Ill raise the roof!
I hate it! I hate your car!
Um

Pam.
I dont wanna be a lousy snitch.
Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot
But its not for--
All that color.
How was the dentist?
Oh
Oh my God.
According to the internet
Whats America gonna do?

I think thats what theyre doing to me. I cant prove it

Fire him. No
Right
I didnt want to miss it.
Good.

Oh...
Hello.

Holly is ruining Michaels life. He thinks she is so special. And shes so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like shes a perfect 40. Its nuts.
You know what? Why dont you stay and Ill go?
Its kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
No.

Oh. Cool.
Super romantic.

Hes just gonna call back.

Dwight doesnt trust robots to give us our messages.
Im taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities
Andy!
Ill go with you.
Navy blue. Little red anchors.
She had so much -
Hey.

Still
You in the bosss chair!
Did you hear anything?
So

But why not find out.
I think Andy should be the boss. Hes just so great. If Im being objective
I... I dont think I can do that.
Well
Yes?
I do really want him.
Jo
Hes all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.

Ive been turned into a puppet!
I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
And theres only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
I need the most special thing in the office.
A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard!
Oh.

Andy

You need to drop it
You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
And we did.
Jim? Tell them what its called.

Novembers sure creeping up
Hey
But thats it? Theres nothing about me

Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didnt stop crying?
Ok. Lets say that I wanted this party to be a tiny
No – just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.

Thanks. Its on medium.
Oh

Im sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now  . This game is called pecker Poker.   Its the game of cards that gets you hard.
All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so...
Sure.
And shes never called here. Unless its your mom.
Two dates? Three dates?
Wow. Im so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. Ill see you guys.

Youre not going to take it?
Ohohohoh.
Youre not going to get it though?
Copy that.
Andy.
You have a very important call.
Are you sure? Its really
Really? Because your mother is dead.
Shes dead. She was hit by a bus.
This isnt one of those times. Its the police. They said its the worst theyve ever seen.
Line 2.
Oh.

And later on tonight
Hey.
Every martini has an olive.
Hey

Its that I wish Jessica was dead.
I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
Too late! Its already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So
Hey.
Hey.
Game on.
I would like another alcohol.
And...
And you have any advice or anything?

Thank you
Does anyone have a first aid kit?
Okay
What is it?

Flying jib.
Dunder Mifflin. Jessica

I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
Oh
How do you know where I live?
Why?
Oh. Come on.
Wow. Andys such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.
Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
How is everything? Hows your car?
Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
Oh
Hi.
I guess Andy isnt totally over his current girlfriend. But
Hey
What you doing?
Ow.
Come on
Yeah.
Oh!
Stop it. Dwight
Oh Dwight!
Stop.
No
Is he looking?   Oh. You can stop.
No
You can actually stop.
Andys not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
What is the most romantic possible thing?
Dwight
Andy
Dang it! What the heck already?
Yes! Woo!
Dwight
Hes not looking.   Hey!
Dwight
One more?
Mush

Sorry if your special night was ruined.
Oh
Andys confused. Thats not what I was hoping for
Hey! Jims back from jury duty.
What was the case?
Ooh
Ah! Angela had the baby!
Ah
We should all go to the hospital and visit her.

Hes more than substantial. Hes a monster.
Is he really five pounds?
Because I squat with five pounds. This-  squats
Oh
Hi.
And heres the fax for you.
Ah! Love to learn.
So...
Were pin twins.
Yeah. Thats cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.  Andy laughs
For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andys still with Jessica
Absolutely. Works for me.

Hey guys
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in
Really? Oh
Im going to Florida.....and Im not coming back.
Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you dont have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check.   Oh
Goodbye for a very very long time.
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
Stanley
