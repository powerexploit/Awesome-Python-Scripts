<h1>Hard to guess easy to remember</h1>
<p>Python script to generate a <b>password</b> which is almost <b>impossible to guess</b> by a attacker, by <b>using the easily remembered words</b> of a user day to day life.</p>

Here I use built-in python <b>module</b> named <b>random</b> used to make random choices.

The programme pics random words and then makes a password for you, Thus Hard or can be said, Impossible to guess or to crack.
