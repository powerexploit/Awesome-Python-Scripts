Code of Conduct
===============
To be effective, the members of the community must work together; our code of conduct lays down the "ground rules" for our cooperative efforts. We have taken a pledge to make open source contribution simplified. Join us in our journey and let's create effective products on our way.

**Note - We have agreed upon the following Code of Conduct as a guide to our collaboration and cooperation.**

Be considerate
--------------
Your work will be used by other people in our community. Any decision taken by you can affect other users and colleagues. We expect you to take those consequences into account while making decisions. For example, when you are working with a new feature, please don't do anything that can affect other's product directly or indirectly.

Be respectful
-------------
Our comminity and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution here. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We all might experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of our community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside our community too.

Be collaborative
----------------
Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You should aim to collaborate with contributors, as well as with the entire community that is interested in the work you do.

Be flexible
-----------
All the members here come from various backgrounds and cultures. Be flexible with other community members in terms of communication.

Ask when unsure
---------------
When you are unsure, ask for help
Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in our community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, therefore, cross questioning is encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.
