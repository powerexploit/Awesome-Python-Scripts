# qrGenerator

- A Python Script that asks the user to input an URL or any string of characters and then coverts it to a QR code as the name of the URL domain, saved locally in the current working directory or as specified by the user.
- Also, if the program finds an existing QR with the same filename, it creates a new one with a random number at the end of the filename.
- Can be used either in the Command Line or within the Python IDE
