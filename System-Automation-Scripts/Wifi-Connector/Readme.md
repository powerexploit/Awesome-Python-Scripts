-Yess..! we can run  commands using python by using os module
```
os.popen()
```
-This will run commands using python
```
os.popen().read()
```
-This will return the output after excuting the line

-For example 
```
 response=os.popen("netsh wlan disconnect").read()

 ```
 -This will connect the present network and return the response after Disconnection

 ```
